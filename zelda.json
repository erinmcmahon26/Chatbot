    "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild": "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a 2017 action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch and Wii U consoles. The game is an installment of The Legend of Zelda series and is set at the end of its timeline. The player controls an amnesiac Link, who awakens from a hundred-year slumber, and attempts to regain his memories and prevent the destruction of Hyrule by Calamity Ganon.\nSimilar to the original 1986 The Legend of Zelda game, players are given little instruction and can explore the open world freely. Tasks include collecting various items and gear to aid in objectives such as puzzle-solving or side quests. The world is unstructured and designed to encourage exploration and experimentation, and the main story quest can be completed in a nonlinear fashion.\nDevelopment of Breath of the Wild took place over five years, following the responses from some fans who wanted a larger game world to explore. Wanting to rethink the conventions of the series, Nintendo introduced elements such as detailed chemistry and physics engines. Monolith Soft, known for their work on the open world Xenoblade Chronicles series, assisted in designing landscapes and topography. The game was originally planned for release in 2015 as a Wii U exclusive but was delayed twice. Released on March 3, 2017, Breath of the Wild was a launch game for the Nintendo Switch and the final Nintendo-published game for the Wii U. Two waves of downloadable content were released in 2017 via an expansion pass.\nBreath of the Wild received universal acclaim for its open-ended gameplay and attention to detail. Critics called it a landmark in open world game design, although it received minor criticism for its technical performance at launch. It won several game of the year awards and has since been cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. Breath of the Wild is also one of the best-selling video games of all time, selling over 28 million copies by 2022. A spin-off, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, was released in 2020. A sequel is set for release on the Switch in 2023.\n\nGameplay\nBreath of the Wild is an open world action-adventure game. Players are tasked with exploring the kingdom of Hyrule while controlling Link. Breath of the Wild encourages nonlinear gameplay, which is illustrated by the game's lack of defined entrances or exits to areas, scant instruction given to the player, and encouragement to explore freely. Breath of the Wild introduces a consistent physics engine to the Zelda series, letting players approach problems in different ways rather than trying to find a single solution. The game also integrates a \"chemistry engine\" that defines the physical properties of most objects and governs how they interact with the player and one another. For example, during thunderstorms, metal objects will attract powerful lightning strikes; during a storm, therefore, a player must be careful not to wear metal, but may also throw metal objects at enemies to draw lightning to them. These design approaches result in a generally unstructured and interactive world that rewards experimentation and allows for nonlinear completion of the story.As Link, players can perform actions such as running, climbing, swimming, and gliding with a paraglider, although Link is limited by his stamina. Link can procure items from the environment, including weapons, food, and other resources. Unlike previous Zelda games, weapons and shields degrade through use. Many items have multiple uses; for example, wooden weapons can light fires, wooden shields can collect incoming enemy arrows, and shields can be used as makeshift snowboards. Players can obtain food and materials for elixirs from hunting animals, gathering wild fruit, or collecting parts of defeated enemies. By cooking combinations of food or materials, the player can create meals and elixirs that can replenish Link's health and stamina, or provide temporary status bonuses such as increased strength or resistance to heat or cold. An important tool in Link's arsenal is the \"Sheikah Slate\", which can be used to mark waypoints on the in-game map and take pictures of materials, creatures, and enemies. These pictures are stored in an in-game compendium that can be used to locate valuable items. The Sheikah Slate also gives the player the ability to create remote bombs, manipulate metal objects, form ice blocks on watery surfaces, and temporarily stop objects in time. In combat, players can lock onto targets for more precise attacks, while certain button combinations allow for advanced offensive and defensive moves. Players may also defeat enemies without weapons, such as by rolling boulders off cliffs into enemy camps.\n\nBesides exploration, players can undergo quests or challenges to obtain certain benefits. Activating towers and shrines will add waypoints to the map that the player may warp to at any time. Activating towers also adds territories to the map, although location names are not added until the player explores that area. Dotted throughout Hyrule are shrines that contain challenges ranging from puzzles to battles against robotic opponents. Clearing shrines earns Spirit Orbs. After earning four of these orbs, they can be traded for additional health or stamina points. When Link has at least 13 hearts, he can reclaim the Master Sword in the Korok Forest. The Master Sword is the only unbreakable weapon in the game;  however it can run out of energy after extended use, requiring a 10 minute recharge. Scattered across Hyrule are small puzzles that reveal Korok Seeds, which can be traded to expand inventory size for weapons, shields, and bows. Towns serve as hotspots for quests, sidequests, and shops selling materials and clothing. Hikers and other travelers offer sidequests, hints, or conversation. Additionally, players can scan Amiibo figures against their controller to summon items or call Link's horse Epona from previous Zelda games and Wolf Link from Twilight Princess.\n\nPlot\nBreath of the Wild takes place at the end of the Zelda timeline in the kingdom of Hyrule. In ancient times long before the beginning of the game, the ancient Sheikah race had developed Hyrule into an advanced civilization, protected by four enormous animalistic machines called the Divine Beasts and an army of autonomous weapons called Guardians. When the evil Calamity Ganon appeared and threatened Hyrule, four great warriors were given the title of Champion, and each piloted one of the Divine Beasts to weaken Ganon while the princess with the blood of the goddess and her appointed knight fought and defeated him by sealing him away.10,000 years later, the kingdom of Hyrule had since regressed to a medieval state. Reading their ancestors' prophecies, the Hylians recognized the signs of Ganon's return and excavated surrounding areas to uncover the Divine Beasts and Guardians. During this time, Princess Zelda trained vigorously to awaken the sealing magic needed to defeat Ganon while trying to maintain her personal research. In the meantime, a knight was appointed to protect her: Link, who was chosen due to his ability to wield the Master Sword, also known as the Sword that Seals the Darkness. The champions of Hyrule's races \u2014 Daruk, warrior of the mountainous Goron; Mipha, princess of the aquatic Zora; Revali, archer of the birdlike Rito; and Urbosa, chief of the desert-dwelling Gerudo \u2014 assembled to pilot the Divine Beasts (Vah Rudania, Vah Ruta, Vah Medoh, and Vah Naboris, respectively) while the current Zelda and Link battled Ganon. However, Ganon possessed the Guardians and Divine Beasts, turning them against Hyrule. King Rhoam and the Champions were killed, the castle town was destroyed, and Link was gravely wounded while defending the Hyrulean Army's only remaining base, Fort Hateno. Zelda took Link to safety for him to heal, hid the Master Sword in the Lost Woods under protection from the Great Deku Tree, and used her magic to seal herself and Ganon in Hyrule Castle. This cataclysmic tragedy came to be known through the ages as the Great Calamity.\n100 years after being placed in a healing chamber in the Shrine of Resurrection, an amnesiac Link awakens in a now-ravaged Hyrule. He meets an old man, who reveals himself as the lingering spirit of King Rhoam. Rhoam explains that Ganon, sealed in Hyrule Castle, has grown stronger; he pleads for Link to defeat Ganon before he breaks free and destroys the world.Link travels across Hyrule, returning to locations from his past and regaining his memories. With the help of the Hyrulean races, he boards the four Divine Beasts and purges them of Ganon's monsters, releasing the spirits of Hyrule's former champions and allowing them to pilot the Divine Beasts once again. After obtaining the Master Sword from the Lost Woods, Link enters Hyrule Castle and defeats Ganon with the help of the Divine Beasts and Zelda's Bow of Light. Zelda seals Ganon away, restoring peace and allowing the spirits of King Rhoam and the champions to depart to the afterlife. Sensing their presence, Link and Zelda smile fondly.\nIf players have found all 13 memories in the quest \"Captured Memories\", they unlock a secret ending in which Zelda realizes that Hyrule must be rebuilt and that she and Link must begin the process by themselves. As Link and Zelda survey Hyrule and embark to rebuild their world, the princess confides that she may no longer possess any supernatural power, yet still she has happily come to terms with it.\n\nDevelopment\nNintendo EPD, an internal division of Nintendo, developed Breath of the Wild for the Nintendo Switch and Wii U. According to series producer Eiji Aonuma, the development team aimed to \"rethink the conventions of Zelda\". Development started immediately upon the release of The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword (2011). Aonuma received comments from players who wished to see a more interconnected map to explore the locales between the gameplay areas. In 2013, Nintendo experimented with nonlinear gameplay in The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, which was a common point of praise from many outlets. At E3 2014, Aonuma said he planned to reform dungeons and puzzles, two of the series' major gameplay elements, and redesign the game to allow players to reach the end without progressing through the story. As Nintendo had never developed a modern open-world game on the scale of Breath of the Wild, they looked at earlier titles to learn more about the challenges of making a modern large-scale open-world game, specifically The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Shadow of the Colossus, which had some similar climbing mechanics and whose creator Fumito Ueda was friends with Aonuma. For the art style, the development team drew inspiration from various Japanese anime which they had grown up watching, suspected to include Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki productions, among other anime. Series protagonist Link was redesigned for the game, with Aonuma purposely making him more gender neutral so that players could more easily relate to him.Before full development, the developers designed a playable 2D prototype similar to the original Zelda to experiment with physics-based puzzles. The final game uses a modified version of the Havok physics engine. At the 2017 Game Developers Conference, director Hidemaro Fujibayashi, technical director Takuhiro Dohta, and art director Satoru Takizawa held a presentation titled \"Change and Constant \u2013 Breaking Conventions with The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\", during which they demoed the prototype. Aonuma called the physics engine in Breath of the Wild a major development for the Zelda series, saying that it \"underpins everything in the world\" and makes things operate in a \"logical and realistic way\", allowing players to approach puzzles and problems in different ways. He expanded on the difficulty in developing this system, recalling how one day during development he entered an area in the game and found that all the objects had been blown away by the wind. As previous Zelda games increased the amount of actions Link could perform, the development team realized that having too many actions would complicate the controls, so instead of adding more actions, they increased the number of events the player could interact with in the world.\n\nThe game was built and demonstrated with touchscreen features for the Wii U, but the developers found that \"looking back and forth between the Gamepad and the screen\" distracted from the game. The features were removed when the game moved to tandem development across the Switch and Wii U. The Wii U GamePad also affected animation; although Link is canonically left-handed, he is right-handed in the game to match the GamePad's control scheme, which has its sword-swinging buttons on its right side. The Switch version performs better than the Wii U release when docked to a television, although when undocked, both run at the same resolution. The Switch version also has higher-quality environmental sounds. Aonuma stated that the art design was inspired by gouache and en plein air art to help identify the vast world. Takizawa has also cited the J\u014dmon period as an inspiration for the ancient Sheikah technology and architecture that is found in the game, due to the mystery surrounding the period. The game's landscape was based on locations in and around Kyoto, the hometown of game director Hidemaro Fujibayashi, and was partially designed by Monolith Soft, who assisted with topographical level design. The game's initial area was made a plateau so that players can see the world's expansive environments.\n\nBreath of the Wild was the first main Zelda game to use voice acting in cutscenes, although Link remains a silent protagonist. Aonuma was affected by the first time he heard a character with a human voice in-game, and wanted to leave a similar impression on players. The team decided to record voice-overs for all cutscenes instead of only the key scenes, as originally planned. Nintendo provided voice-overs and subtitles in eight languages. Initially, players were not able to mix and match the languages of voices and subtitles; however, Nintendo released an update in May 2017 that allowed players to choose the voice-over language. After five years of development, the game went gold on February 3, 2017, with Nintendo holding a wrap party to celebrate. Coinciding with the game's launch in Taiwan and South Korea in early 2018, Nintendo introduced a patch worldwide adding traditional and simplified Chinese and Korean translations for the Nintendo Switch version.The original score was composed by Manaka Kataoka, Yasuaki Iwata, and Hajime Wakai. Kataoka and Wakai had previously worked on the Zelda games Spirit Tracks and The Wind Waker respectively. The soundtrack was primarily written and performed on a piano, with a focus on ambient music and sounds rather than melodic and upbeat music as seen in previous Zelda games. According to Wakai, this helped add \"authenticity\" to the environments and was taken on as a challenge by the rest of the sound team.\n\nRelease\nAonuma originally teased the game for the Wii U in January 2013 during a Nintendo Direct presentation. The game, he continued, would challenge the series' conventions, such as the requirement that players complete dungeons in a set order. The next year, Nintendo introduced the game's high-definition, cel-shaded visual style with in-game footage at its E3 2014 press event. Once planned for release in 2015, the game was delayed early in the year and did not show at that year's E3. Zelda series creator Shigeru Miyamoto reaffirmed that the game was still set for release on the Wii U, despite the development of Nintendo's next console, the Nintendo Switch. The game was delayed again in April 2016 due to problems with its physics engine. Nintendo let attendees play the game's Wii U version at E3 2016, where they also announced its subtitle, Breath of the Wild. CNET said that the showing would \"take your breath away\", and Breath of the Wild was the most talked-about E3 2016 game on social media according to Brandwatch, a social media monitoring platform. It was also listed among the best games at E3 by Eurogamer, GameSpot, and GamesRadar+. At a Nintendo presentation in January 2017, a trailer was shown announcing that the game would be released as a launch game for the Switch.Breath of the Wild launched for both the Wii U and Switch on March 3, 2017. It was the last Nintendo game released for the Wii U. The Switch version was available in limited \"Special Edition\" and \"Master Edition\" bundles, which both included a Sheikah Eye coin, a Calamity Ganon tapestry with world map, a soundtrack CD, and a themed carrying case for the Switch. The Master Edition also included a figurine based on the Master Sword. An \"Explorer's Edition\" was released for the Switch on November 23, 2017, containing a two-sided map and a 100-page book of story information. In Europe, the game used unique packing artwork. A five-disc, 211-track soundtrack was released in Japan on April 25, 2018.\n\nDownloadable content\nOn June 30, 2017, Nintendo released a \"season pass\" for two bundled downloadable content (DLC): The Master Trials and The Champions' Ballad. The Master Trials adds gameplay modes, features, and items. In the Trial of the Sword challenge, the player faces three trials, consisting of twelve, sixteen, and twenty-three rooms respectively. Each room is full of enemies which the player must defeat before proceeding. Every room must be completed before the player can claim their reward. The player begins with no equipment and will lose all progress if they receive a game over. At the end of each trial the player's Master Sword has its attack power upgraded by ten points and the blue sheen of its blade grows slightly. By the end of the third trial, the Master Sword will have doubled in attack power and will glow blue. The pack also adds an option to play the game at a higher difficulty level, called \"Master Mode\", which adds faster rank leveling and raises the ranks of enemies by 1. The enemies are more perceptive when Link sneaks near them and slowly regenerate health in battle. New floating platforms throughout the land offer enemies to battle and treasure as a reward. The Hero's Path feature draws the player's path on the game's map, designed to help players determine places they have not visited. The player can also find the hidden Travel Medallion to save Link's current position as a single waypoint to which the player can transport Link at any time. New items include the Korok Mask, which alerts the player when a Korok is nearby, and other themed cosmetics related to previous Zelda games.The Champions' Ballad was released on December 7, 2017. It added a new dungeon, additional story content, new gear, and additional challenges, as well as the Master Cycle Zero, a motorcycle-like vehicle that Link can ride upon completing the quest line.A \"Complete Edition\" containing all DLC on the game card was released in Japan on October 8, 2021.\n\nReception\nBreath of the Wild was released to critical acclaim, with many calling the game a masterpiece and one of the greatest video games of all time. On the review aggregator Metacritic, Breath of the Wild was the highest-rated game of 2017 and holds the largest number of perfect reviews of any game from any year. Industry publications including IGN, GameSpot, Polygon, Entertainment Weekly, Eurogamer, Electronic Gaming Monthly, GamesRadar+, and Game Informer ranked Breath of the Wild the best game of 2017. According to Metacritic, Breath of the Wild topped 18 lists of the decade's best games, more than any other game of the 2010s.The open-world gameplay received praise. Jose Otero of IGN described it as \"a masterclass in open-world design\" and \"a wonderful sandbox full of mystery, dangling dozens upon dozens of tantalizing things in front of you that just beg to be explored\". GameSpot called it the most impressive game Nintendo had made, writing that it \"takes designs and mechanics perfected in other games and reworks them for its own purposes to create something wholly new, but also something that still feels quintessentially like a Zelda game ... It's both a return to form and a leap into uncharted territory, and it exceeds expectations on both fronts.\" Edge wrote that the game world was \"an absolute, and unremitting, pleasure to get lost in\" and that \"the magic of being given all the tools in the opening hour is the knowledge that the solution to any problem is already at your disposal, and you can always change tack\". According to Digital Trends, the ability to climb any surface and glide across the map gave players freedom of movement that \"broke the genre open, pushing developers to rethink how players interact with the world\" and \"putting extra thought into vertical design.\" In contrast to \"Ubisoft-style\" games that filled the game's map with points of interests and objectives, Breath of the Wild's free-form exploration encourage players to set their own objectives, marking the map with discoveries that serve as \"a record of what players have accomplished.\"According to Kyle Orland of Ars Technica, \"after spending a week utterly immersed in Nintendo's open-world reimagining of the tried-and-true Zelda formula, it's hard to return to the more formulaic entries of the franchise's past\". Journalists commented on unexpected interactions between game elements, with serendipitous moments proving popular on social media. Chris Plante of The Verge predicted that whereas prior open-world games tended to feature prescribed challenges, Zelda would influence a new generation of games with open-ended problem-solving. Digital Trends wrote that the game's level of experimentation allowed players to interact with and exploit the environment in creative ways, resulting in various \"tricks\" still discovered years after release.Reviewers lauded the sense of detail and immersion. Kotaku recommended turning off UI elements in praise of the indirect cues that contextually indicate the same information, such as Link shivering in the cold or waypoints appearing when using the scope. Reviewers also commented on the unexpected permutations of interactions between Link, villagers, pets, and enemies, many of which were shared widely on social media. A tribute to former Nintendo president Satoru Iwata, who died during development, also attracted praise.Jim Sterling was more critical than most, giving Breath of the Wild a 7/10 score. They criticized the difficulty, weapon durability, and level design, but praised the open world and variety of content. Other criticism focused on the unstable frame rate and the low resolution of 900p; updates addressed some of these problems.In a 2021 poll conducted by TV Asahi, polling over 50,000 Japanese users, Breath of the Wild was voted the best console game of all time, above Dragon Quest V at number two.In 2021, IGN listed Breath of the Wild as #1 in their list of top 100 games of all time.\n\nSales\nBreath of the Wild broke sales records for a Nintendo launch game in multiple regions. In Japan, the Switch and Wii U versions sold a combined 230,000 copies in the first week of release, with the Switch version becoming the top-selling game released that week. In the UK, Breath of the Wild was the second-bestselling retail game its week of release behind Horizon Zero Dawn, and became the third-bestselling Zelda game behind Wind Waker and Twilight Princess. In the United States, Breath of the Wild was the second-bestselling video game during its month of release behind Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands. Nintendo reported that Breath of the Wild sold more than one million copies in the US that month, 925,000 of which were for Switch \u2013 a 100% attach rate. In April 2017, Nintendo reported it had sold 3.84 million copies of Breath of the Wild worldwide by the end of March, 1.08 million for Wii U and 2.76 million for Switch, surpassing the Switch's global sales of 2.74 million for the same period. Nintendo president Tatsumi Kimishima said that the attach rate of Breath of the Wild to the Switch was \"unprecedented\". By March 2019, the game sold 14.27 million copies worldwide, 12.77 on the Switch and 1.61 on the Wii U, making Breath of the Wild the best-selling game in the franchise. Total sales for the Switch version reached 26.55  million by March 2022. It has sold 1.69 million copies on the Wii U.\n\nAwards\nFollowing its demonstration at E3 2016, Breath of the Wild received several accolades from the Game Critics Awards and from publications such as IGN and Destructoid. It was listed among the best games at E3 by Eurogamer, GameSpot, and GamesRadar+. In late 2016, Breath of the Wild received two awards at Gamescom, and won the award for Most Anticipated Game at The Game Awards 2016.After its release, Breath of the Wild won multiple awards at The Game Awards 2017, including Game of the Year, Best Game Direction, and Best Action/Adventure Game, and was nominated for Best Art Direction, Best Score/Music, and Best Audio Design. At the 2018 21st Annual D.I.C.E. Awards, it won Game of the Year among other awards.\n\nLegacy\nShortly after Breath of the Wild's release, journalists and video game industry figures discussed how it would influence future open-world games and the Zelda series. Benjamin Plich, designer of Assassin's Creed: Unity and For Honor, said that he believed developers would take inspiration from its focus on experimental and emergent gameplay, such as \"the ability to experiment with things more freely, in an open way\" and having \"a powerful sense of autonomy and experimentation with the environment and the tools at their disposal.\" Damien Monnier, designer of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, said Breath of the Wild \"managed to bring classic open world mechanics together while not relying on them to guide the player through its world,\" encouraging players to \"go and explore it because you wonder what's out there, not because a loot icon tells you to.\" Its \"reactive physics\" sandbox design was \"a revelation for the open world genre at large\" according to Screen Rant, and the game was noted for its experimental chemistry engine, emphasizing chemistry as much as physics. PC Gamer wrote that the game \"[set] a standard the rest of the genre should live by.\"In the years since its release, multiple games and developers have cited Breath of the Wild as an inspiration. These include Genshin Impact, Ghost of Tsushima, Immortals: Fenyx Rising, Telling Lies, Halo Infinite, Elden Ring, and Forspoken. Similarities have also been noted between Breath of the Wild and other open world titles since its launch, including Pokemon Legends: Arceus, Sonic Frontiers  and Horizon: Forbidden West. According to Digital Trends, Breath of the Wild has become a popular point of comparison among open world games, \"approaching \u201cIt\u2019s the Dark Souls of\u2026\u201d levels of clich\u00e9.\"The game's success sparked increased interest in the Wii U emulator Cemu, as the Cemu developers rapidly updated the software to run the game at a steady frame rate within weeks of release.In September 2020, Nintendo announced Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, a hack and slash game in the style of Dynasty Warriors series, following 2014's Hyrule Warriors. Age of Calamity is a spin-off of Breath of the Wild, with the story set 100 years before. The game was released on November 20, 2020, on the Nintendo Switch.\n\nSequel\nAn untitled sequel was announced at E3 2019 for the Switch. It was conceived during planning for Breath of the Wild's DLC; the team came up with too many ideas, some of which could not be implemented due to technical constraints, so they decided to use their ideas for a new game. According to Aonuma, the sequel will build atop the original's world with a new story and gameplay elements, and is inspired in part by Red Dead Redemption 2. Fujibayashi will reprise his role as director. Originally set to be released in 2022, it was announced in March 2022 that the game had been delayed to Spring 2023.\n\nExplanatory notes\nReferences\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Creating a Champion.

    "Untitled The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild sequel": "An untitled sequel to the 2017 action-adventure game The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (colloquially referred to as Breath of the Wild 2) is in development by Nintendo. It is a mainline installment of The Legend of Zelda series and is currently aimed to be released in the first half of 2023 for the Nintendo Switch.\n\nDevelopment and marketing\nDevelopment of the sequel started in 2017 after the production of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild ended, and in the E3 2019 Nintendo Direct, a teaser trailer was released.In a Nintendo Direct in February 2021, Zelda series producer Eiji Aonuma stated that the developers would disclose further information regarding the game later that year. In the subsequent E3 2021 Nintendo Direct, Nintendo debuted a trailer revealing gameplay, story, and a 2022 release. Although the trailer did not feature an official game title, several fan theories emerged about the plot of the game. According to spokesperson Bill Trinen, Nintendo is keeping the subtitle secret because \"those subtitles [...] start to give little bits of hints about maybe what's going to happen.\" Trinen also responded to the fan's comparisons of the sequel and The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask\u2014a previous darker-toned, direct sequel that used the same assets as its predecessor. He deemed the comparisons unfair, claiming that Nintendo's upcoming reveals will showcase \"where this game stands on its own and what makes it so unique.\"Hidemaro Fujibayashi will reprise his role as director. The developers, inspired by leftover ideas from the prior game's development and downloadable content packs, will incorporate the original game's world into a new story and gameplay elements. At the game's presentation during E3 2021, Aonuma stated that \"the setting for the adventure has been expanded to include the skies above Hyrule\", drawing some comparisons to The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword's intended scope and vision.On March 29, 2022, Aonuma announced that the game had been delayed to the first half of 2023 for the purpose of extending development time.\n\nReception\nAwards\n\n\n== References ==",
    "The Legend of Zelda": "The Legend of Zelda is a high fantasy action-adventure video game franchise created by Japanese game designers Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka. It is primarily developed and published by Nintendo, although some portable installments and re-releases have been outsourced to Capcom, Vanpool, and Grezzo. The gameplay incorporates action-adventure and elements of action RPG games.\nThe series centers on the various incarnations of Link, a courageous young Hylian man, with pointy elf-like ears; and Princess Zelda, a magical princess that is the mortal reincarnation of the goddess Hylia; as they fight to save the magical land of Hyrule from Ganon, an evil warlord turned demon king, who is the principal antagonist of the series. Ganon wishes to use the Triforce, a sacred relic left behind by the three goddesses that created Hyrule to remake the world in his own dark image. When gathered together, the power of the Triforce can grant any wish its user desires; however, if someone with a heart that does not possess a balance of the three virtues of Power, Courage and Wisdom attempts to touch the Triforce, it will split into three triangles and bond with three people whose hearts embody the required virtue.\nAlthough their personalities and backstory differ from game to game, the incarnations of Link and Zelda often have many traits in common; such as Link often being left-handed and associated with the color green while Princess Zelda is often a member of the royal family. While the conflict with Ganon serves as a backbone for the series, some games have featured other settings and antagonists, with Link traveling or being sent to these other lands in their time of need.\nSince the original Legend of Zelda was released in 1986, the series has expanded to include 19 entries on all of Nintendo's major game consoles, as well as a number of spin-offs. An American animated TV series based on the games aired in 1989 and individual manga adaptations commissioned by Nintendo have been produced in Japan since 1997. The Legend of Zelda is one of Nintendo's most prominent and successful franchises; several of its entries are considered to be among the greatest video games of all time.\n\nOverview\nGameplay\nThe Legend of Zelda games feature a mix of puzzles, action, adventure/battle gameplay, and exploration. These elements have remained constant throughout the series, but with refinements and additions featured in each new game. Later games in the series also include stealth gameplay, where the player must avoid enemies while proceeding through a level, as well as racing elements. Although the games can be beaten with a minimal amount of exploration and side quests, the player is frequently rewarded with helpful items or increased abilities for solving puzzles or exploring hidden areas. Some items are consistent and appear many times throughout the series (such as bombs and bomb flowers, which can be used both as weapons and to open blocked or hidden doorways; boomerangs, which can kill or paralyze enemies; keys for locked doors; magic swords, shields, and bows and arrows), while others are unique to a single game. Though the games contain role-playing elements (Zelda II: The Adventure of Link is the only one to include an experience system), they emphasize straightforward hack-and-slash-style combat over the strategic, turn-based or active time combat of series like Final Fantasy. The game's role-playing elements, however, have led to much debate over whether or not the Zelda games should be classified as action role-playing games, a genre on which the series has had a strong influence. Miyamoto himself disagreed with the RPG label, but classified Zelda as \"a real-time adventure game\"; he said he was \"not interested in systems where everything in the game is decided by stats and numbers\" but what's \"important to me is to preserve as much of that \u201clive\u201d feeling as possible\" which he said \"action games are better suited in conveying\" to players.Every game in the main Zelda series has consisted of three principal areas: an overworld which connects all other areas, in which movement is multidirectional, allowing the player some degree of freedom of action; areas of interaction with other characters (merely caves or hidden rooms in the first game, but expanding to entire towns and cities in subsequent games) in which the player gains special items or advice, can purchase equipment or complete side quests; and dungeons, areas of labyrinthine layout, usually underground, comprising a wide range of difficult enemies, bosses, and items. Each dungeon usually has one major item inside, which can be essential for solving many of the puzzles within that dungeon and often plays a crucial role in defeating that dungeon's boss, as well as progressing through the game. In nearly every Zelda game, navigating a dungeon is aided by locating a map, which reveals its layout, and a magic compass, which reveals the location of significant and smaller items such as keys and equipment. In later games, the dungeon includes a special \"big key\" that will unlock the door to battle the dungeon's boss enemy and open the item chest.\nIn most Zelda games, the player's HP or life meter is represented by a line of hearts, each heart typically representing two hit points. At the start of the game the player only has three hearts but players can increase their max hearts by finding heart-shaped crystals called \"Heart Containers\". Full heart containers are usually received at the end of dungeons and dropped by dungeon bosses. Smaller \"Pieces of Heart\" are awarded for completing side quests or found hidden around the game world in various places, and require a certain number (usually four) to form a full heart container. Health can be replenished by picking up hearts left by defeated enemies or destroyed objects, consuming items such as potions or food, or going to a Great Fairy Fountain to have the Great Fairy heal Link completely. Occasionally the player will find fairies hidden in specific locations; these fairies can either heal Link immediately or be kept in empty bottles, and will revive the player the next time they die.\nThe games pioneered a number of features that were to become industry standards. The original Legend of Zelda was the first console game with a save function that enabled players to stop playing and then resume later. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time introduced a targeting system that let the player lock the camera on to enemy or friendly NPCs which simplified 3D combat.\n\nAudio\nGames in The Legend of Zelda series frequently feature in-game musical instruments, particularly in musical puzzles, which are widespread. Often, instruments trigger game events: for example, the recorder in The Legend of Zelda can reveal secret areas, as well as warp Link to the Dungeon entrances.  This warping with music feature has also been used in A Link to the Past and Link's Awakening. In Ocarina of Time, playing instruments is a core part of the game, with the player needing to play the instrument through the use of the game controller to succeed. Ocarina of Time is \"[one of the] first contemporary non-dance title[s] to feature music-making as part of its gameplay\", using music as a heuristic device and requiring the player to utilise songs to progress in the game \u2013 a game mechanic that is also present in Majora's Mask.\"The Legend of Zelda Theme\" is a recurring piece of music that was created for the first game of the franchise. The composer and sound director of the series, Koji Kondo, initially planned to use Maurice Ravel's Bol\u00e9ro as the game's title theme, but was forced to change it when he learned, late in the game's development cycle, that the copyright for the orchestral piece had not yet expired. As a result, Kondo wrote a new arrangement of the overworld theme within one day. The \"Zelda Theme\" has topped ScrewAttack's \"Top Ten Videogame Themes Ever\" list.Up until Breath of the Wild, the Legend of Zelda series avoided using voice acting in speaking roles, relying instead on written dialogue. Series producer Eiji Aonuma previously stated that as Link is entirely mute, having the other characters speak while Link remains silent \"would be off-putting\". Instead of theme music for different locations, Breath of the Wild plays natural ambience around the player as main sounds, in addition to some minimalist piano music.\n\nInspiration\nThe Legend of Zelda was principally inspired by Shigeru Miyamoto's \"explorations\" as a young boy in the hillsides, forests, and caves surrounding his childhood home in Sonobe, Japan where he ventured into forests with secluded lakes, caves, and rural villages. According to Miyamoto, one of his most memorable experiences was the discovery of a cave entrance in the middle of the woods. After some hesitation, he apprehensively entered the cave, and explored its depths with the aid of a lantern. Miyamoto has referred to the creation of the Zelda games as an attempt to bring to life a \"miniature garden\" for players to play with in each game of the series.The story and setting was developed by Takashi Tezuka. Seeking to create a fairytale adventure game, Tezuka drew inspirations from fantasy books such as J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. According to Keiji Terui, who wrote the backstory in the first game's manual, the location named Death Mountain was initially a working title for the legend of the Triforce which was written with inspirations from the battles of medieval Europe. The Master Sword was introduced as Excalibur in the French version of A Link to the Past,  which originates from the legend of King Arthur in the Welsh collection of Mabinogion. Celtic mythology also inspired the name of Link's steed, Epona, based on the Celtic goddess of fertility.Hearing of American novelist, socialite and painter Zelda Fitzgerald, Miyamoto thought the name sounded \"pleasant and significant\". Paying tribute, he chose to name the princess after her, and titled it The Legend of Zelda. Link and the fairy were inspired by Peter Pan and Tinker Bell. When making the series made the transition to 3D, the combat system of Ocarina of Time was based on the chanbara (samurai) style of Japanese sword fighting.\n\nSetting\nThe Legend of Zelda takes place predominantly in a medieval Western Europe-inspired fantasy world called Hyrule, which has developed a deep history and wide geography over the series's many releases. Much of the backstory of the creation of Hyrule was revealed in the games A Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, The Wind Waker, Twilight Princess, Skyward Sword, and A Link Between Worlds. Hyrule's principal inhabitants are pointy-eared, elf-like humanoids called Hylians, which include the player character, Link, and the eponymous princess, Zelda.\nAccording to the in-game backstories, the world of Hyrule was created by the three golden goddesses: Din, Farore, and Nayru. Before departing, the goddesses left a sacred artifact called the Triforce, which could grant powers to the user. It physically manifests itself as three golden triangles in which each embodies one of the goddesses' virtues: Power, Courage, and Wisdom. However, because the Triforce has no will of its own and it can not judge between good and evil, it will grant any wish indiscriminately. Because of this, it was placed within an alternate world called the \"Sacred Realm\" or the \"Golden Land\" until one worthy of its power and has balanced virtues of Power, Wisdom, and Courage in their heart could obtain it, in its entirety. If a person is not of a balanced heart, the triforce part that the user mostly believes in will stay with that person and the remainder will seek out others. In order to master and control the triforce as a whole, the user must get the other parts found in other individuals and bring them together to reunite them. The Sacred Realm can itself be affected by the heart of those who enters it: those who are pure will make it a paradise, while those who are evil will transform it into a dark realm.In Skyward Sword, the Triforce was sought by the Demon King Demise, an eternal being that had conquered time itself. After a long battle against the goddess Hylia, guardian of the Triforce, Demise was sealed away within her temple. Hylia, placing the Hylians on a floating island (called Skyloft) in the sky to protect them, orchestrated a means to stop the demon from escaping: creating the Goddess Sword (later becoming the Master Sword) for her chosen hero and discarding her divinity to be reborn among the people of Skyloft. In time, Zelda and Link (the reborn Hylia and her predestined warrior) enacted the goddess's plan and Demise was destroyed, but he vowed that his rage would be reborn and forever plague those descended from Link and Zelda. That prophecy came to fruition in Ocarina of Time, when Ganondorf's attempt to get the Triforce scattered it with him gaining the Triforce of Power. The Triforce of Wisdom ended up with the Hylian princesses descended from Zelda, each named after her, while the Triforce of Courage is passed to a youth named Link across generations. While the Triforces of Power and Wisdom have been part of the series since the original The Legend of Zelda, it was only in Zelda II: The Adventure of Link that the Triforce of Courage was first introduced, being obtained by Link at the end of his quest. The Triforce, or even a piece of it, is not always distributed as a whole. Such as in The Wind Waker, Link must find all the pieces (called Triforce Shards) of the Triforce of Courage before he can return to Hyrule. Even in the original The Legend of Zelda, Zelda breaks her Triforce of Wisdom into 8 pieces for Link to find, before she was captured by Ganon.\nThe fictional universe established by the Zelda games sets the stage for each adventure. Some games take place in different lands with their own back-stories. Hytopia is a connected kingdom, Labrynna and Holodrum are different countries separate from the Kingdom of Hyrule, Termina and Lorule serve as parallel worlds, and Koholint is an island far away from Hyrule that appears to be part of a dream.\n\nFictional chronology\nThe chronology of the Legend of Zelda series was a subject of much debate among fans until an official timeline was released within the Hyrule Historia collector's book, which was first released in Japan in December 2011. Prior to its release, producers confirmed the existence of a confidential document, which connected all the games. Certain materials and developer statements once partially established an official timeline of the released installments. Zelda II: The Adventure of Link is a direct sequel to original The Legend of Zelda, and takes place several years later. The third game, A Link to the Past, is a prequel to the first two games, and is directly followed by Link's Awakening. Ocarina of Time is a prequel that takes the story many centuries back; according to character designer Satoru Takizawa, it was meant to implicitly tell the story of the Imprisoning War from the manual of A Link to the Past, with Majora's Mask directly following its ending. Skyward Sword is then a prequel to Ocarina of Time. Twilight Princess is set more than 100 years after Ocarina of Time.The Wind Waker is parallel, and takes place in the other timeline branch, more than a century after the adult era of Ocarina of Time. Phantom Hourglass is a continuation of the story from The Wind Waker, and is followed by Spirit Tracks, which is set about 100 years later on a supercontinent far away from the setting of The Wind Waker. At the time of its release, Four Swords for the Game Boy Advance was considered the oldest tale in the series's chronology, with Four Swords Adventures set sometime after its events. The Minish Cap precedes the two games, telling of the origins of villain Vaati and the creation of the Four Sword. A Link Between Worlds takes place six generations after A Link to the Past. Important events that occur in the game include the Triforce being reunited, and Ganon being resurrected.Nintendo's 2011 timeline announcement subsequently posits that following Ocarina of Time, the timeline splits into three alternate routes: in one, Link fails to defeat Ganon, leading into the Imprisoning War and A Link to the Past, Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages, Link's Awakening (A Link Between Worlds and Tri Force Heroes were released after the timeline), The Legend of Zelda and The Adventure of Link. In the second and third, Link is successful, leading to a timeline split between his childhood (when Zelda sends him back in time so he can use the wisdom he has gained to warn Zelda in the past of the horrifying fate of Hyrule) and adulthood (where the Zelda from the future lives on to try and rebuild the kingdom). His childhood continues with Majora's Mask, followed by Twilight Princess and Four Swords Adventures. The timeline from his adult life continues into Wind Waker, Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks.\nIn the early 2000s, Nintendo of America released a timeline on the official website of the series, which interpreted all stories up to the Oracle games as the adventures of a single protagonist named Link. At one point, translator Dan Owsen and his coworkers at Nintendo of America had conceived another complete timeline and intended to make it available online, but the Japanese series developers rejected the idea so the timeline would be kept open to the imagination of the players.In 2018, Nintendo revealed that Breath of the Wild officially takes place after all previous games in the series (without specifying a connection to any of the three timelines), and moved Link's Awakening to take place before Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages.In November 2020, Nintendo released Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity. The game is marketed as a prequel to Breath of the Wild, being set 100 years before. However, the events of Age of Calamity diverged from the backstory established in Breath of the Wild, creating an alternate timeline separate from Breath of the Wild.\n\nCharacters\nLink\nThe central protagonist of The Legend of Zelda series, Link is the name of various young male Hylians who characteristically wear a green tunic and a pointed cap, and are the bearers of the Triforce of Courage. In most games, the player can give Link a different name before the start of the adventure, and he will be referred by that given name throughout by the non-player characters (NPCs). In Link's Awakening, if the player steals from the shop, characters would later refer to him as \"Thief\". Miyamoto said in a 2002 interview that he named the protagonist \"Link\" because the character is/was supposed to be the \"link\" between the player and the game world that he (Miyamoto) had created. The various Links each have a special title, such as \"Hero of Time\", \"Hero of the Winds\" or \"Hero chosen by the gods\". Like many silent protagonists in video games, Link does not speak, only producing grunts, yells, or similar sounds. Despite the player not seeing the dialogue, it is referenced second-hand by in-game characters, showing that he is not, in fact, mute. Link is shown as a silent protagonist so that the audience is able to have their own thoughts as to how their Link would answer the characters instead of him having scripted responses.\n\nPrincess Zelda\nPrincess Zelda is the princess of Hyrule and the guardian of the Triforce of Wisdom. Her name is present in many of her female ancestors and descendants. While most games require Link to save Zelda from Ganon, she sometimes plays a supporting role in battle, using magical powers and weapons such as Light Arrows to aid Link. With the exception of the CD-i games (which were not official Nintendo games), she was not playable in the main series until Spirit Tracks, where she becomes a spirit and can possess a Phantom Knight that can be controlled by the player. Zelda appears under various other aliases and alter egos, including Sheik (in Ocarina of Time) and Tetra (in The Wind Waker and Phantom Hourglass). In Skyward Sword, it is revealed that the Zelda of that game is a reincarnation of the goddess Hylia, whose power flows through the royal bloodline. The name \"Zelda\" derives from the American novelist Zelda Fitzgerald.\n\nGanon\nGanon, also known as Ganondorf in his humanoid form, is the main antagonist and the final boss in the majority of The Legend of Zelda games. In the series, Ganondorf is the leader of a race of desert brigands called the Gerudo, which consists entirely of female warriors save for one man born every one hundred years. He is significantly taller than other human NPCs, but his looks vary between games, often taking the form of a monstrous anthropomorphic boar. His specific motives vary from game to game, but most often his plans include him kidnapping Princess Zelda and planning to achieve domination of Hyrule and presumably the world beyond it. To this end, he seeks the Triforce, a powerful magical relic. He often possesses a portion of the Triforce called the Triforce of Power, which gives him great strength. However, it is often not enough to accomplish his ends, leading him to hunt the remaining Triforce pieces. Unlike Link, Zelda, and most other recurring characters, he is actually the same person in every game, with the exception of Four Swords Adventures, where he is a reincarnation of the original. In each game the battles with him are different and he fights using different styles. The game Skyward Sword indicates that Ganon is a reincarnation of an evil deity known as Demise.\n\nHistory\n2D origins (1986\u20131993)\nThe Legend of Zelda, the first game of the series, was first released in Japan on February 21, 1986, on the Famicom Disk System. A cartridge version, using battery-backed memory, was released in the United States on August 22 and in Europe on November 27, 1987, respectively. The game features a \"Second Quest\", accessible either upon completing the game, or by registering one's name as \"ZELDA\" when starting a new quest. The \"Second Quest\" features different dungeons and item placement, and more difficult enemies. A modified version of the original Famicom game, BS Zelda no Densetsu, was released for the Super Famicom's satellite-based expansion, Satellaview, on August 6, 1995, in Japan. A second Satellaview game, BS Zelda no Densetsu MAP2 was released for the Satellaview on December 30 the same year. Both games featured rearranged dungeons, an altered overworld, and new voice-acted plot-lines.The second game, Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, was released for the Famicom Disk System in Japan on January 14, 1987, and for the Nintendo Entertainment System in Europe in November and North America in December 1988. The game exchanged the top-down perspective for side-scrolling (though the top-down point of view was retained for overworld areas), and introduced RPG elements (such as experience points) not used previously or thereafter in the series. The Legend of Zelda and Zelda II were released in gold-coloured  cartridges instead of the console's regular grey cartridges. Both were re-released in the final years of the Nintendo Entertainment System with grey cartridges.Four years later, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past returned to the top-down view (under a 3/4 perspective), and added the concept of an alternate dimension, the Dark World. The game was released for the Super NES on November 21, 1991. A downloadable version of A Link to the Past  and an exclusive modified version called BS Zelda no Densetsu Inishie no Sekiban were released on the Satellaview in Japan on March 2 and 30, 1997, respectively. A Link to the Past was re-released for the Game Boy Advance in 2002. The SNES version was later re-released on the Wii Virtual Console on January 22, 2007, on the Wii U Virtual Console, and on Nintendo Switch Online.\nThe next game, Link's Awakening, for Nintendo's Game Boy, is the first Zelda for a handheld, and the first set outside Hyrule and to exclude Princess Zelda. Link's Awakening was re-released, in full color, as a launch game for the Game Boy Color in 1998 as Link's Awakening DX. This remaster features additions such as an extra color-based dungeon and a photo shop that allows interaction with the Game Boy Printer. Link's Awakening DX was released on the 3DS' Virtual Console on June 7, 2011. An HD remake of Link's Awakening was released for the Nintendo Switch in 2019.\n\nTransition to 3D (1998\u20132002)\nAfter five years without a new game, the series made the transition to 3D with Ocarina of Time for the Nintendo 64, which was released in November 1998. This game, initially known as Zelda 64, retains the core gameplay of the previous 2D games, and was very successful commercially and critically, considered by many critics and gamers to be the best video game of all time, and ranking highly on IGN and EGM's \"greatest games of all time\" lists, as well as scoring perfect scores in several video game publications. In February 2006, it was ranked by Nintendo Power as the best game released for a Nintendo console. The game was originally developed for the poorly selling, Japanese-only 64DD, but was converted to cartridge format when the 64DD hardware was delayed. A new gameplay mechanic, lock-on targeting, is used in the game, which focuses the camera on a nearby target and alters the player's actions relative to that target. Such mechanics allow precise sword fighting in a 3D space. The game heavily uses context-sensitive button play, which enabled the player to control various actions with Link using only one button on the Nintendo 64's controller. Each action was handled slightly differently but all used the 'A' button to perform. For instance, standing next to a block and pressing 'A' made Link grab it (enabling him to push/pull it), but moving forwards into a block and pressing 'A' allowed Link to climb the block. The game featured the first appearance of Link's horse, Epona, allowing Link to travel quickly across land and fire arrows from horseback. Those who preordered the game received a gold-coloured cartridge in a limited edition box with a golden plastic card affixed, reading \"Collector's Edition\". In some stores that had this \"Collector's Edition\" quickly sell out, a small and rare Zelda pin was given instead. It is the sword and shield emblem with \"Zelda\" written on it. Very few of them are known to remain. Ocarina of Time was re-released on the GameCube in 2002, when it was offered as a pre-order incentive for The Wind Waker in the U.S., Canada and Japan. It includes the canceled 64DD expansion for Ocarina of Time known as Ura Zelda during development. Named Ocarina of Time Master Quest, the game was given reorganized dungeon layouts for greater difficulty. Europe continued to receive this \"Two-Game Bonus Disc\" free in every copy of The Wind Waker, except for the discounted Player's Choice version. Ocarina of Time was available through the Wii's Virtual Console service. Nintendo re-released it for the Wii U Virtual Console in July 2015. Ocarina of Time 3D for the 3DS, featuring remade graphics and stereoscopic 3D, was released in mid-June 2011. Ocarina of Time has been made available on the higher tier of Nintendo Switch Online in HD resolution. \nOcarina of Time's follow-up, Majora's Mask, was released in April 2000. It uses the same 3D game engine as the previous game, and added a time-based concept, in which Link, the protagonist, relives the events of three days as many times as needed to complete the game's objectives. It was originally called Zelda Gaiden, a Japanese title that translates as Zelda Side story. Gameplay changed significantly; in addition to the time-limit, Link can use masks to transform into creatures with unique abilities. While Majora's Mask retains the graphical style of Ocarina of Time, it is also a departure, particularly in its atmosphere. It features motion-blur, unlike its predecessor. The game is darker in tone, dealing with death and tragedy in a manner not previously seen in the series, and has a sense of impending doom, as a large moon slowly descends upon the land of Termina to destroy all life. All copies of Majora's Mask are gold cartridges. A limited \"Collector's Edition\" lenticular cartridge label was offered as the pre-order incentive. Copies of the game that are not collector's editions feature a normal sticker cartridge label. Majora's Mask was available on the Wii and Wii U Virtual Console catalogues. The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D was released for 3DS in North America and Europe on February 13, 2015, and in Japan and Australia a day later. The Nintendo 64 version was added to Nintendo Switch Online in February 2022; with this, all of the 3D games in the series have been re-released in HD resolution. \nWhen Nintendo revealed the GameCube on August 24, 2000, the day before Nintendo's SpaceWorld 2000 exposition, a software demonstration showed a realistically styled real-time duel between Ganondorf and Link. Fans and the media speculated that the battle might be from a Zelda game in development at the time.At Spaceworld 2001, Nintendo showed a cel-shaded Zelda game, later released as The Wind Waker in December 2002. Due to poor reception, nothing further was shown until a playable demonstration was ready. Miyamoto felt The Wind Waker would \"extend Zelda's reach to all ages\". The gameplay centres on controlling wind with a baton called the \"Wind Waker\" and sailing a small boat around an island-filled ocean, retaining similar gameplay mechanics as the previous 3D games in the series. The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD was released for Wii U in 2013.\nThe Legend of Zelda: Collector's Edition, released for the GameCube in 2003, included the original The Legend of Zelda, Zelda II, Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, and a demo of The Wind Waker. GameSpot noted that Majora's Mask suffered from a frame rate which appeared choppier and inconsistencies in the audio. This compilation was never sold commercially, and originally could only be obtained by purchasing a GameCube bundled with the disc (in North America, Europe and Australia), by registering a GameCube and two games at Nintendo.com, or by subscribing or renewing a subscription to Nintendo Power (in North America) or Club Nintendo in Sweden. In the UK, 1000 copies were made available through the Club Nintendo Stars Catalogue program. After these were quickly claimed, Nintendo gave a copy to customers who mailed in proof of purchases from select GameCube games.\n\nFurther 2D games and introduction of multiplayer (2001\u20132005)\nOracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages were released simultaneously for the Game Boy Color, and interact using passwords or a Game Link Cable. After one game has been completed, the player is given a password that allows the other game to be played as a sequel. They were developed by Flagship in conjunction with Nintendo, with supervision from Miyamoto. After the team experimented with porting the original The Legend of Zelda to the Game Boy Color, they decided to make an original trilogy to be called the \"Triforce Series\". When the password system linking the three games proved too troublesome, the concept was reduced to two games at Miyamoto's suggestion. These two games became Oracle of Ages, which is more puzzle-based, and Oracle of Seasons, which is more action-oriented. Both titles were later released on the 3DS Virtual Console.\nThe cartridge for A Link to the Past on Game Boy Advance featured a new game, Four Swords, the first multiplayer Zelda. Four Swords Anniversary Edition was released on September 28, 2011 as free DSiWare available until February 20, 2012. \nFour Swords Adventures was released for the GameCube in early 2004 in Japan and America, and January 2005 in Europe. Based on the handheld Four Swords, Four Swords Adventures was another deviation from previous Zelda gameplay, focusing on level-based and multiplayer gameplay. The game contains 24 levels and a map screen; there is no connecting overworld. For multiplayer features, each player must use a Game Boy Advance system linked to the GameCube via a Nintendo GameCube \u2013 Game Boy Advance link cable. The game features a single-player campaign, in which using a Game Boy Advance is optional. Four Swords Adventures includes two gameplay modes: \"Hyrulean Adventure\", with a plot and gameplay similar to other Zelda games, and \"Shadow Battle\", in which multiple Links, played by multiple players, battle each other. The Japanese and Korean versions include an exclusive third segment, \"Navi Trackers\" (originally designed as the stand-alone game \"Tetra's Trackers\"), which contains spoken dialogue for most of the characters, unlike other games in The Legend of Zelda series.\nIn November 2004 in Japan and Europe, and January 2005 in America, Nintendo released The Minish Cap for the Game Boy Advance. In The Minish Cap Link can shrink in size using a mystical, sentient hat named Ezlo. While shrunk, he can see previously explored parts of a dungeon from a different perspective, and enter areas through otherwise-impassable openings. It was later released on the Wii U Virtual Console.\n\nMotion- and touch-based swordplay (2006\u20132011)\nIn November 2006, Twilight Princess was released as the first Zelda game on the Wii, and later in December as the last Nintendo-published game for the GameCube, the console for which it was originally developed. The Wii version features a reversed world where everything that is in the west on the GameCube is in the east on the Wii. The display is mirrored in order to make Link right-handed to make use of the Wii remote feel more natural for the majority of players. The game chronicles the struggle of a young adult Link to confront the troubles of the \"Twilight Realm\", a mysterious force that appears around and interacts with Hyrule. When he enters this realm, he is transformed into a wolf, and loses the ability to use his sword, shield or other items, but gains other abilities such as sharpened senses from his new form. Twilight Princess includes an incarnation of Link's horse, Epona, for fast transportation, and features mounted battle scenarios including boss battles that were not seen in previous games. Twilight Princess diverted from the cel-shading of Wind Waker, integrating graphics featuring more detailed textures, giving the game a darker atmosphere. The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD released for Wii U in 2016.At 2006 Game Developers Conference, a new title Phantom Hourglass for the Nintendo DS was shown. It revealed traditional top-down Zelda gameplay optimised for the DS's features, with a cel-shaded 3D graphical style similar to The Wind Waker for Gamecube. The game is a direct sequel to The Wind Waker. Phantom Hourglass was released on June 23, 2007, for Japan and October for North America and Europe. It was later released on the Wii U Virtual Console.\nThe next Legend of Zelda for the DS, The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks, was released in December 2009. In this game, the \"spirit tracks\", railroads which chain an ancient evil, are disappearing from Hyrule. Zelda and Link go to the 'Spirit Tower' (the ethereal point of convergence for the tracks) to find out why, but villains steal Zelda's body for the resurrection of the Demon King. Rendered disembodied, Zelda is left a spirit, and only Link (and a certain few sages) can see her. Together they go on a quest to restore the spirit tracks, defeat the Demon King, and return Zelda to her body. Using a modified engine of that used in Phantom Hourglass, the notably new feature in this game is that the Phantom Guardians seen in Phantom Hourglass are, through a series of events, periodically controllable. It was the first time in the series that both Link and Zelda work together on the quest. It was later released on the Wii U Virtual Console.\nA new Zelda game for Wii was in development since the end of 2000s. The new title was revealed at E3 2010 as Skyward Sword, but its release was delayed to 2011. The game, the earliest in the Legend of Zelda timeline, reveals the origins of Hyrule, Ganon and many elements featured in previous games; it uses Wii's MotionPlus feature as well. It was released on November 20, 2011; the first run included a 25th Anniversary CD of fully orchestrated music from various Zelda games, including Skyward Sword. It was made available for download on Wii U in September 2016. The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD, with optional button-only controls, released for Nintendo Switch in 2021.\n\nOpen-world emphasis (2013\u2013present)\nIn 2013, Nintendo released The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds for the Nintendo 3DS, which takes place in the same setting as A Link to the Past. Progression is more open-ended than previous titles, with the possibility of completing many of the game's dungeons in any order. Certain dungeon obstacles require the use of rented or purchased items.The Legend of Zelda: Tri Force Heroes, a cooperative multiplayer game, was released for the 3DS in October 2015. It features the same Link as A Link Between Worlds but lacks open-world gameplay.\nWhile Nintendo had showcased a Wii U demo reel at E3 2011 that depicted Link fighting a monster in HD and the first original HD Zelda game was set in 2014 for a 2015 release, it was delayed. The title was finally revealed at E3 2016 as Breath of the Wild, and the game was released for Wii U and Nintendo Switch on March 3, 2017. Similar to the original The Legend of Zelda, players are given little instruction and can explore the world freely. The world is designed to encourage exploration and experimentation and the main story quest can be completed in a nonlinear fashion.\nAn untitled Breath of the Wild sequel was announced in 2019 and is set for release on the Switch in 2023.\n\nOther games\nCD-i games\nA series of video games was developed and released for the Philips CD-i in the early 1990s as a product of a compromise between Philips and Nintendo, after the companies failed to develop a CD-ROM peripheral for the Super NES. Created independently with no observation by or influence from Nintendo, the games are Link: The Faces of Evil and Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon, together with Zelda's Adventure. Nintendo never acknowledged them in the Zelda timeline, and they are considered to be in a separate, self-contained canon. These games are widely acknowledged to be the worst installments in the series, though have since gained a cult following in the form of internet memes.\n\nLCD games\nThree Zelda-themed LCD games were created between 1989 and 1992. The Zelda version of Nintendo's Game & Watch series was released first in August 1989 as a dual-screen handheld electronic game similar in appearance to today's Nintendo DS. It was re-released in 1998 as a Toymax, Inc. Mini Classic and was later included as an unlockable extra in Game & Watch Gallery 4, a 2002 compilation for the Game Boy Advance. While the Game & Watch Zelda was developed in-house by Nintendo, the subsequent two LCD games were developed by third parties under license by Nintendo. In October 1989, The Legend of Zelda was developed by Nelsonic as part of its Game Watch line. This game was an actual digital watch with primitive gameplay based on the original Legend of Zelda. In 1992, Epoch Co. developed Zelda no Densetsu: Kamigami no Triforce for its Barcode Battler II console. The game employed card-scanning technology similar to the later-released Nintendo e-Reader.\n\nCanceled games\nThroughout the lifespan of The Legend of Zelda series, a number of games (including main series games as well as re-releases and spin-offs) in varying states of completeness have had their releases canceled. Perhaps the earliest of these was Gottlieb's The Legend of Zelda Pinball Machine (canceled 1993). After securing a license from Nintendo to produce two Nintendo-franchise-based pinball machines, pinball designer Jon Norris was tasked with designing the table. Before it was completed, Gottlieb decided to repurpose the game with an American Gladiators theme. Licensing for this version ultimately fell through and the game was released as simply Gladiators (November 1993).In 1998, Nintendo canceled Ura Zelda, the Ocarina of Time expansion disk for the 64DD due to poor sales figures for the 64DD peripheral. In 2002, Nintendo released a bonus disc called The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Master Quest. It contains emulated versions of Ocarina of Time and Ocarina of Time Master Quest, which Aonuma and Miyamoto each confirmed is Ura Zelda.In 2001, under license from Nintendo, Capcom canceled the release of The Legend of Zelda: Mystical Seed of Courage for Game Boy Color. Working with a Capcom team, Yoshiki Okamoto was originally tasked with designing a series of three Zelda games for the Game Boy Color. Referred to as the \"Triforce Series\", the games were known as The Legend of Zelda: The Mysterious Acorn: Chapter of Power, Chapter of Wisdom, and Chapter of Courage in Japan and The Legend of Zelda: Mystical Seed of Power, Mystical Seed of Wisdom, and Mystical Seed of Courage in the US. The games were to interact using a password system, but the limitations of this system and the difficulty of coordinating three games proved too complicated, so the team scaled back to two games at Miyamoto's suggestion. The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons was adapted from Mystical Seed of Power, The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages was adapted from Mystical Seed of Wisdom, and Mystical Seed of Courage was canceled.Before its 2006 release, both Link and Samus from the Metroid series were planned to be playable characters for the Wii version of Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, but they didn't make the final release because they weren't Marvel characters.In 2011, an unnamed Zelda 25th Anniversary Compilation was canceled. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the series, Nintendo of America originally had planned to release a compilation of games together for the Wii, similar to the collector's edition disc released for the GameCube in 2003. Nintendo of Japan's president Satoru Iwata and Shigeru Miyamoto decided against releasing it, believing it would be too similar to the Super Mario 25th Anniversary collection released in 2010.\n\nSpin-off games\nAs the franchise has grown in popularity, several games have been released that are set within or star a minor character from the universe of The Legend of Zelda but are not directly connected to the main The Legend of Zelda series. Both map versions of the game BS Zelda no Densetsu for the Satellaview (released in August and December 1995) could be considered spin-offs due to the fact that they star the \"Hero of Light\" (portrayed by either the Satellaview's male or female avatar) as opposed to Link as the protagonist of Hyrule. A third Satellaview game released in March 1997, BS Zelda no Densetsu Inishie no Sekiban (BS The Legend of Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets) could also be considered a spin-off for the same reason. Other spin-off games include Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland for the Nintendo DS \u2013 an RPG released in September 2006 in Japan (Summer of 2007 in the UK) to star supporting character Tingle. A second Tingle game is Tingle's Balloon Fight DS for the Nintendo DS. Here Tingle again stars in this spin-off arcade style platformer, released in April 2007 only in Japan and available solely to Platinum Club Nintendo members.\nIn addition to games in which Link does not star as the protagonist, games such as the shooter game, Link's Crossbow Training (for the Wii), have been considered spin-offs due to the lack of a traditional \"Save Hyrule\" plot-line. Released in November 2007 as a bundle with the Wii Zapper, this game allows players to assume the identity of Link as he progresses through a series of tests to perfect his crossbow marksmanship. Color Changing Tingle's Love Balloon Trip was released in Japan in 2009 as a sequel to Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland.\nHyrule Warriors, a crossover game combining the setting of Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda series and the gameplay of Tecmo Koei's Dynasty Warriors series, was released in North America in September 2014 for Wii U. Hyrule Warriors Legends, a version for the Nintendo 3DS containing more content and gameplay modifications, was released in March 2016.\nTo commemorate the launch of the My Nintendo loyalty program in March 2016, Nintendo released My Nintendo Picross: The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, a Picross puzzle game developed by Jupiter for download to the Nintendo 3DS.Cadence of Hyrule, developed by Brace Yourself Games and released on June 13, 2019, is an officially licensed crossover of Zelda with Crypt of the NecroDancer.Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity was unveiled in September 2020. Developed by Koei Tecmo, the game shares the hack-and-slash style of the spin-off game Hyrule Warriors. Age of Calamity was released on November 20, three months after its reveal in September.A new Zelda-themed variant of Vermin was included on the limited edition Game & Watch: The Legend of Zelda unit, which also included The Legend of Zelda, The Adventure of Link, and Link\u2019s Awakening.\n\nCross-overs\nThe Legend of Zelda series has crossed over into other Nintendo and third-party video games, most prominently in the Super Smash Bros. series of fighting games published by Nintendo. Link appears as a fighter in Super Smash Bros. for the Nintendo 64, the first entry in the series, and is part of the roster in all subsequent releases in the series as well. Zelda (who is able to transform into Sheik as well), Ganondorf, and Young Link (the child version of Link from Ocarina of Time) were added to the player roster for Super Smash Bros. Melee, and appeared in all subsequent releases except for \"Young Link\" (who is later replaced by \"Toon Link\" from The Wind Waker, in subsequent releases Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U). Both Young Link and Toon Link appear in the fifth installment, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Other elements from the series, such as locations and items, are also included throughout the Smash Bros. series. Outside of the series, Nintendo allowed for the use of Link as a playable character exclusively in the GameCube release of Namco's fighting game Soulcalibur II.\nLink, using a design based on Skyward Sword, appears as a playable character in Mario Kart 8 via downloadable content (DLC), along with a \"Hyrule Circuit\" racetrack themed on The Legend of Zelda series. The first pack is named after the series. In a post-launch update for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Link and his vehicle received alternate styles based on Breath of the Wild.\nIn Sonic Lost World, a DLC stage based on The Legend of Zelda series was released in March 2014, named \"The Legend of Zelda Zone\". It was built around the core gameplay mechanics of Sonic Lost World, with some elements from the Zelda series, including a heart-based vitality meter, rupee collection, and a miniature dungeon to explore.\n\nReception and legacy\nThe Legend of Zelda series has received outstanding levels of acclaim from critics and the public. Ocarina of Time, The Wind Waker, Skyward Sword, and Breath of the Wild have each received a perfect 40/40 score (10/10 by four reviewers) by Japanese Famitsu magazine, making Zelda one of the few series with multiple perfect scores. Ocarina of Time was even listed by Guinness World Records as the highest-rated video game in history, citing its Metacritic score of 99 out of 100. Computer and Video Games awarded The Wind Waker and Twilight Princess a score of 10/10. A Link to the Past has won Gold Award from Electronic Gaming Monthly. In Nintendo Power's Top 200 countdown in 2004, Ocarina of Time took first place, and seven other Zelda games placed in the top 40. Twilight Princess was named Game of the Year by X-Play, GameTrailers, 1UP, Electronic Gaming Monthly, Spacey Awards, Game Informer, GameSpy, Nintendo Power, IGN, and many other websites. The editors of review aggregator websites GameRankings, IGN and Metacritic have all given Ocarina of Time their highest aggregate scores. Game Informer has awarded The Wind Waker, Twilight Princess, Skyward Sword, A Link Between Worlds and Breath of the Wild with scores of 10/10. Phantom Hourglass was named DS Game of the Year by IGN and GameSpy. Airing in December 2011, Spike TV's annual Video Game Awards gave the series the first ever \"Hall of Fame Award\", which Miyamoto accepted in person. Ocarina of Time and its use of melodic themes to identify different game regions has been called a reverse of Richard Wagner's use of leitmotifs to identify characters and themes. Ocarina of Time was so well received that sales increased for real ocarinas. IGN praised the music of Majora's Mask for its brilliance despite its heavy use of MIDI. It has been ranked the seventh-greatest game by Electronic Gaming Monthly, whereas Ocarina of Time was ranked eighth. The series won GameFAQs Best Series Ever competition.As of March 2022, The Legend of Zelda franchise has sold over 126 million copies, with the original The Legend of Zelda being the fourth best-selling NES game of all time. The series was ranked as the 64th top game (collectively) by Next Generation in 1996. In 1999, Next Generation listed the Zelda series as number 1 on their \"Top 50 Games of All Time\", commenting that Zelda series had always more gameplay and innovations than most other titles in their series. According to British film magazine Empire, with \"the most vividly-realised world and the most varied game-play of any game on any console, Zelda is a solid bet for the best game series ever.\"\n\nImpact\nMultiple members of the game industry have expressed how Zelda games have impacted them, including Rockstar Games founder and Grand Theft Auto director, Dan Houser, who said that Zelda and Mario games on Nintendo 64 greatly influenced them in developing Grand Theft Auto series, as well in other 3D games in general. Rockstar founder and Grand Theft Auto director Sam Houser also cited the influence of Zelda, describing Grand Theft Auto III as \"Zelda meets Goodfellas\". \u014ckami director Hideki Kamiya (Capcom, PlatinumGames) said that he has been influenced by The Legend of Zelda series in developing the game, citing A Link to the Past as his favorite game of all time. Soul Reaver and Uncharted director, Amy Hennig (Crystal Dynamics and Naughty Dog), cited Zelda as inspiration for the Legacy of Kain series, noting A Link to the Past's influence on Blood Omen and Ocarina of Time's influence on Soul Reaver. Soul Reaver and Uncharted creator, Richard Lemarchand (Crystal Dynamics and Naughty Dog), also cited A Link to the Past's approach to combining gameplay with storytelling as inspiration for Soul Reaver. Wing Commander and Star Citizen director, Chris Roberts (Origin Systems and Cloud Imperium Games), cited Zelda as an influence on his action role-playing game, Times of Lore.Souls creator Hidetaka Miyazaki (FromSoftware) named A Link To The Past as one of his favorite role-playing video games. According to Miyazaki, \"The Legend of Zelda became a sort of textbook for 3D action games.\" Ico director Fumito Ueda (Team Ico) cited Zelda as an influence on Shadow of the Colossus. Peter Molyneux (Lionhead Studios and Microsoft Studios) stated that the Twilight Princess is one of his favorite games and an influence for the Fable series. Darksiders director David Adams (Vigil Games) cited Zelda as an influence on his work. Prince of Persia and Assassin's Creed director Raphael Lacoste (Ubisoft) cited The Wind Waker as an influence on Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. CD Projekt Red (The Witcher, Cyberpunk 2077) cited the Zelda series as an influence on The Witcher series, including The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Alex Hall cited Majora's Mask as the primary influence on their Ben Drowned web serial and web series. Final Fantasy and The 3rd Birthday director Hajime Tabata (Square Enix) cited Ocarina of Time as inspiration for the seamless open world of Final Fantasy XV.\n\nOther media\nTV series\nA 13-episode American animated TV series, adapted by DiC and distributed by Viacom Enterprises, aired in 1989. The animated Zelda shorts were broadcast each Friday, instead of the usual Super Mario Bros. cartoon which was aired during the rest of the week. The series loosely follows the two NES Zelda games (the original The Legend of Zelda and The Adventure of Link), mixing settings and characters from those games with original creations. The show's older incarnations of both Link and Zelda appeared in various episodes of Captain N: The Game Master during its second season.A live-action television series had been in development around 2015, as reported from an anonymous Netflix employee to The Wall Street Journal. The program was a joint effort between Netflix and Nintendo, and was said to aimed as a family-friendly version of Game of Thrones. Further details of this series went sparse until 2021 when Adam Conover gave an interview regarding his College Humor period. There, the College Humor team had been planning a skit that would have combined Star Fox with Fantastic Mr. Fox and had even had talked to Miyamoto on the project. Conover said that they were told about a month into the project that Nintendo had requested they stop all work on the project as a result of the leak related to the live-action Zelda show; Nintendo, already protective of its IP, had pulled many external projects including the live-action show.\n\nPrint media\nValiant Comics released a short series of comics featuring characters and settings from the Zelda cartoon as part of their Nintendo Comics System line. Manga adaptations of many entries in the series, including A Link to the Past,  Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages, Four Swords Adventures, The Minish Cap, Phantom Hourglass, and Twilight Princess have been produced under license from Nintendo, primarily written and drawn by Japanese artist duo Akira Himekawa. These adaptations do not strictly follow the plot of the games from which they are based and may contain additional story elements.A number of official books, novels, and gamebooks have been released based on the series as well. The earliest was Moblin's Magic Spear, published in 1989 by Western Publishing under their Golden Books Family Entertainment division and written by Jack C. Harris. It took place sometime during the first game. Two gamebooks were published as part of the Nintendo Adventure Books series by Archway, both of which were written by Matt Wayne. The first was The Crystal Trap (which focuses more on Zelda) and the second was The Shadow Prince. Both were released in 1992. A novel based on Ocarina of Time was released in 1999, written by Jason R. Rich and published by Sybex Inc. under their Pathways to Adventure series. Another two gamebooks were released as part of the You Decide on the Adventure series published by Scholastic. The first book was based on Oracle of Seasons and was released in 2001. The second, based on Oracle of Ages, was released in 2002. Both were written by Craig Wessel. In 2006, Scholastic released a novel as part of their Nintendo Heroes series, Link and the Portal of Doom. It was written by Tracey West and was set shortly after the events of Ocarina of Time.\nIn 2011, to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the series, an art book was published exclusively in Japan under the name Hyrule Historia by Shogakukan. It contains concept art from the series's conception to the release of Skyward Sword in 2011 and multiple essays about the production of the games, as well as an overarching timeline of the series. It also includes a prequel manga to Skyward Sword by Akira Himekawa. The book received an international release by publisher Dark Horse Comics on January 29, 2013; it took the number one spot on Amazon's sales chart, taking the spot away from E. L. James's 50 Shades of Grey trilogy. Dark Horse released The Legend of Zelda: Art & Artifacts, a follow-up art book to Hyrule Historia containing additional artwork and interviews, in North America and Europe in February 2017.\n\nMusic\nTaking place in Cologne, Germany, on September 23, 2010, the video game music concert Symphonic Legends focused on music from Nintendo and, among others, featured games such as The Legend of Zelda. Following an intermission, the second half of the concert was entirely dedicated to an expansive symphonic poem dedicated to the series. The 35-minute epic tells the story of Link's evolution from child to hero.To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the series in 2011, Nintendo commissioned an original symphony, The Legend of Zelda: Symphony of the Goddesses. The show was originally performed in the fall of 2011 in Los Angeles and consists of live performances of much of the music from the series. It has since been scheduled for 18 shows so far throughout the United States and Canada. Nintendo released a CD, The Legend of Zelda 25th Anniversary Special Orchestra CD. Featuring eight tracks from live performances of the symphony, the CD is included alongside the special edition of The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword for the Wii. Nintendo later celebrated The Legend of Zelda's 30th anniversary with an album which was released in Japan in February 2017.\n\nMerchandise\nThe Legend of Zelda-themed Monopoly board game was released in the United States on September 15, 2014. A Clue board game in the style of The Legend of Zelda series was released in June 2017. A UNO-styled The Legend of Zelda game was released in February 2018, exclusively at GameStop in North America.A limited edition Zelda 25th anniversary 3DS was released on December 1, 2011, in Australia.\n\nPotential films\nIn 2007, Imagi Animation Studios, which had provided the animation for TMNT and Astro Boy, created a pitch reel for a computer-animated The Legend of Zelda movie. Nintendo did not accept the studio's offer due to the memory of the failure of the 1993 live-action movie adaption of Super Mario Bros.In 2013, Aonuma stated that, if development of a film began, the company would want to use the opportunity to embrace audience interaction in some capacity.\n\nNotes\nGroup n\n\nReferences\nWorks cited\n\n\"ZELDA: The Second Quest Begins\".

    "Universe of The Legend of Zelda": "The Legend of Zelda is a video game franchise created by Japanese video game designers Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka. It is mainly developed and published by Nintendo. The universe of the Legend of Zelda series consists of a variety of lands, the most predominant being Hyrule. The franchise is set within a fantasy world that is reminiscent of medieval Europe and consists of several recurring locations, races and creatures. The most prominent population in the series are the Hylians, a humanoid race with elfin features, that are identifiable by their long, pointed ears. The constructed world is accompanied by a detailed fictional lore that contains a creation myth, several constructed languages, the most prominent being Hylian, and a fictional universal currency called the rupee.\n\nHyrule\nConcept and design\nJapanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto conceived the land of Hyrule as the setting for the original 1986 video game The Legend of Zelda. He described Hyrule as, \"a miniature garden that you can put into a drawer and revisit anytime you like\". He drew his inspiration from the Kyoto countryside that he had explored in his childhood and wanted to recreate the experience of adventure and discovery. Alongside writer Takashi Tezuka, Miyamoto created a fantasy world in the style of fantasy authors like Tolkien, which was viewed from a top-down perspective. It was populated with colourful characters, monsters and dungeons for the player to explore.\n\n2D world design\nMiyamoto and Tezuka started working on The Legend of Zelda during the development of Super Mario Bros. Initially, the game did not feature an overworld. In Hyrule Historia, Miyamoto said that Nintendo aimed to develop a launch title for the Famicon Disk System. An early game was initially designed to make use of the Disk System's ability to rewrite data, allowing players to create dungeons and explore other players' creations. He explained, \"We made a one-player game with dungeons under mountains that surrounded Death Mountain, but we couldn't shake that, \"I want to play above ground, too!\" feeling, so we added forests and lakes, and eventually Hyrule Field.\"The first specifications were drawn up on a whiteboard by Miyamoto and then copied onto a document on 1 February 1985. The document detailed early concepts for items and enemies that would later feature in the game, such as a compass, bows and arrows and a boomerang, and \"Hakkai\" an early name given to Ganon. This was developed into rough sketches for various items and enemies within the following two weeks. The name for the game had not yet been decided, so the title was simply labelled \"Adventure\". Long paper was used to create the first land map of Hyrule, which was developed by Tezuka and Miyamoto sitting side by side and drawing together. Miyamoto said that the name \"Hyrule\" seemed like the perfect choice during a discussion to find a name for a high-fantasy region. In Japan, The Legend of Zelda game was released as The Hyrule Fantasy, which was almost chosen as the name for the entire franchise, but was dropped after the first game. Miyamoto said this could have been due to the name being too similar to Final Fantasy, which was released soon afterwards.The original Hyrule map was designed to encourage exploration and discovery, requiring up to several hours to navigate. The map is nonlinear, so players are free to choose from several unmarked paths, with just a few areas being inaccessible at the start. Miyamoto was influenced by The Black Onyx and Ultima, two games that centre around fantasy dungeon crawling. The Zelda world was defined by its mazes, hidden rooms and treasures. The game's nine dungeons were designed to be difficult to locate, forcing players to uncover the secrets of the map with little help. In addition to its underworld, the Hyrule map consists of a large overworld created out of a grid structure that is much larger than can be displayed on a single screen. It is 16 blocks wide and eight blocks high and comprises 128 areas. Miyamoto said that maps for the game were included in North America and explained, \"The maps included various hints, but to be honest, I thought it would be more enjoyable to play the game without any help. So we sealed the map, with a message reading 'You should only use the map and strategic tips as a last resort.'\" Players were required to begin their adventure in the centre of Hyrule and use instinct alone to find an old man inside a cave who gives Link a sword and declares, \"It's dangerous to go alone!\". While navigating Hyrule's overworld and its many dangerous enemies, players must eventually find the dungeons, which each feature various enemies, items and a boss.The concept of a role-playing game was a new experience for players in the 1980s. The gameplay diverged from the fast-paced games typically found in arcades like Super Mario Bros, by offering players an open world to explore, puzzles to solve and a fantasy story that centres on a protagonist embarking on an adventure to save a princess from an evil villain and bring peace to Hyrule. The new game concept caused concern with Nintendo's management. In 2003, Miyamoto stated in an interview for Superplay magazine, \"I remember that we were very nervous, because The Legend Of Zelda was our first game that forced the players to think about what they should do next.\" He continued, \"We were afraid that gamers would become bored and stressed by the new concept.\" During the testing phase, players complained about getting lost inside the game's dungeons, but rather than making the game more simplistic, Miyamoto decided to make it more challenging by removing Link's sword at the beginning of the game and forcing players to locate it. He wanted to encourage players to communicate with each other while solving the game's puzzles.\n\nTransition to 3D\nHyrule continued to evolve over the course of successive games. The transition from a 2D to 3D world occurred with the release of Ocarina of Time, due to the capabilities of the Nintendo 64, which gave players the opportunity to experience a more realistic game environment. The 3D world was also accompanied by an expanding fictional lore that laid the foundation for other games in the series within an official fictional timeline. The game's dungeons were each unique and connected to a specific area of Hyrule and its inhabitants. Several recurring races, such as the Gorons, Zora and Gerudo were introduced and given a distinct history and culture. Hyrule Field, an expansive open grassy area, was positioned at the centre of Hyrule, acting as a hub that connects other areas to create the illusion of a vast world. The game's time travel mechanic also introduced a dark version of Hyrule Kingdom, a land corrupted by Ganondorf's influence, with Hyrule Castle Town in ruins and Redead zombies as its inhabitants.Due to concerns about the limitations of the Nintendo 64, Miyamoto initially conceived the game taking place within a central hub in the confines of Ganon's Castle, similar to Peach's Castle in Super Mario 64. He said that he had approached the game by first focusing on what types of characters he wanted to include, rather than on the story or the game functions. Ocarina of Time was designed with several innovations to help the player navigate the expansive 3D world and interact with the environment. The camera system was designed to integrate with the 3D world of Hyrule, giving the player a sense of perspective and tracking the movements of Link. The game's Z-targeting system was created to provide the player with a simple way to lock on and interact with objects, characters and enemies in the game world. The game also made use of context sensitive controls by using the A button for a range of interactions, such as mounting a horse or opening a treasure chest. These features were landmarks for Nintendo and influenced 3D world development within the games industry.During development, the staff spent less time on developing the dungeons. Miyamoto stated, \"Instead of mapping your way through a maze, I think what's more important is a sense of dread, a sense of pressure, and of course an opportunity for finding secrets and solving puzzles\u2014we should be pursuing an emotional immediacy, the sense that you are really there.\" Hyrule and its characters in Ocarina of Time were depicted in an art style that drifted towards Western fantasy, although Miyamoto said there was no intentional replication of cultural elements from one specific country. Hyrule's fantasy characters were partially inspired by the American television series Twin Peaks. In an interview, Takashi Tezuka said he had used the series as inspiration when creating Link's Awakening and said, \"After that, in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, all kinds of suspicious characters appeared.\" Many assets and character models in the game were later reused for Majora's Mask, both for stylistic purposes and to save development time.\n\nOpen air concept\nProducer Eiji Aonuma approached Breath of the Wild by breaking the conventions of previous games. He explained that in Ocarina of Time, the game world featured \"routes\" to help players navigate the 3D environment without getting lost, but that certain handholding and blockages had caused players to feel frustrated. By contrast, Breath of the Wild's Hyrule was designed to allow the player to explore a vast world in any way they liked. Nintendo's senior product marketing manager Bill Trinen described the game as \"open air\" commenting, \"I look at this game and I see a world that is fully integrated into the exploration and the adventure. It's not just a world that you're passing through. It's sort of a world that you're a part of.\" The game world benefited from advancements in Nintendo hardware. Earlier games had been restricted by the available technology, creating the need to separate Hyrule into individual connecting areas, but the game world could now be experienced as a seamless environment. The concept of an \"open air\" environment began during work on The Wind Waker. Aonuma said that he wanted to remove the small connecting areas of The Wind Waker and replace them with open expanses, but the world ended up feeling smaller than he intended.\n\nBreath of the Wild's open world was inspired by other video games. The game's director Hidemaro Fujibayashi named Minecraft and Terraria as his inspirations for \"the sense of adventure, exploration and how it inspired curiosity\". Aonuma also mentioned several other games that he had played, including The Witcher, Far Cry and Skyrim. He also cited Skyward Sword as the basis for many of the world's mechanics, such as the ability to climb and explore between areas. The development team began Breath of the Wild by working on a 2D prototype of Hyrule to test interactions between objects. This was developed into a complex physics and chemistry engine that would present a higher level of realism. The chemistry engine allowed for elements, such as fire, water and electricity to interact with each other and objects in the game world. This was designed to provide the player with a more interactive gameplay that was coined \"chemical reaction play\". Hyrule in Breath of the Wild was depicted using an art style that was based on the stylised visuals of The Wind Waker but developed into a more realistic, detailed style. The civilization of the Hylians was developed with a focus on their castle in the style of medieval Europe to return to the roots of the series, while the ancient technological features of the Sheikah were inspired by the J\u014dmon period of Japanese history.Fujibayashi stated that the layout of Hyrule in Breath of the Wild was inspired in part by his hometown of Kyoto. He commented, \"I took a map of Kyoto and overlaid it on the game world, and I tried to imagine going to places that I know in Kyoto. I'd think 'It takes this much time to get from point A to point B, so how does that translate to the game?' And that's how we started mapping out the world in Breath of the Wild.\" The development team used landmarks in Kyoto as a way of comparing the distance between landmarks in the game world, which helped staff during the development of the game. This measurement of distance allowed Hyrule to be scaled up to an enormous world that appears twelve times the size of its predecessor in Twilight Princess. For the untitled sequel to Breath of the Wild, Aonuma confirmed that the game would revisit the same map of Hyrule as the one players experienced in Breath of the Wild. He commented, \"One of the reasons we wanted to create a continuation was because I wanted to revisit that Hyrule again and use that world again, while incorporating new gameplay and new story\".\n\nDepiction\nThe Kingdom of Hyrule, a medieval-based fantasy land, is the main setting of the series, which first appeared in The Legend of Zelda. Many of its areas have recurring appearances throughout the series, like Hyrule Castle, the Lost Woods, Kakariko Village, Death Mountain and Lake Hylia.\nHyrule was formed by three goddesses Din, Farore, and Nayru. It is established in Ocarina of Time that Din created the physical geography of the realm, Nayru created the physical laws to govern the land, and Farore created the races to uphold the law and the flora and fauna that inhabit the world. Once the goddesses had completed their tasks, they departed for the heavens, and left behind three golden triangles. In these, they put their power to govern all things; this relic became known as the Triforce. The realm itself was eventually named Hyrule after its dominant race, the Hylians, who established a kingdom across the land. The kingdom is ruled by the Royal Family of Hyrule, into which the various incarnations of Princess Zelda are often born.Hylian is a constructed language that first appears in A Link to the Past, where it is identified as \"the ancient language of the Hylians\" and is composed of symbols that Link must translate to progress. In Japan, an explanation of the Hylian alphabet was written on the back of the instruction manual for The Wind Waker with a phonographic writing system, or syllabary, like the Japanese language. Since its first appearance, five more Hylian scripts have been developed and deciphered: the Old Hylian Syllabary used in Ocarina of Time, the Modern Hylian Syllabary used in The Wind Waker, the Hylian Alphabet used in Skyward Sword, the Hylian Alphabet used in A Link Between Worlds, and the Hylian Alphabet used in Twilight Princess. The first three are used for transcribing Japanese, while the latter three are used to transcribe English, totalling six variations of written Hylian. Additional languages have subsequently appeared in the series. The language of the Gerudo was introduced in Ocarina of Time, a written and spoken language that is similar to Hylian and is written in elongated, wispy letters. The Sheikah language was introduced in Breath of the Wild and consists of a complete alphabet of square-shaped symbols. Players have deciphered these languages to translate numerous signs and inscriptions commonly found around Hyrule.The universal currency of Hyrule is the rupee. Although it shares its name with the real-world currency, Miyamoto said in an interview that this was not intentional and that he chose the word because it seemed cute and sounded like \"rubies\". Rupees resemble hexagonal crystals or gems and come in various colors that determine their value. In the manual for the original game, the currency was called rubies but this was changed to rupees in later games. Subsequent games introduced more colors and sizes for rupees, each denoting a specific value. Generally, green rupees have the least value, while gold and silver rupees have the most.\n\nHyrulean geography\nHyrulean topography has been revamped with each game in The Legend of Zelda series, resulting in recurring geographical landmarks appearing in locations that vary in relation to each other.Death Mountain is a large volcanic mountain located in northern Hyrule. In Twilight Princess it is revealed to be part of a mountain range in the Eldin Province called the Eldin Mountains. The main inhabitants of Death Mountain are the Gorons, a race of rock-eating golems that mine the mountains in search of food and the mountains are littered with caves as a result of the Goron's mining activities.\nSpectacle Rock is a location consisting of two large rock formations next to each other that resemble a pair of eyeglasses. It housed the final dungeon in the original game. It is usually associated with Death Mountain, but is located in the Gerudo Highlands in Breath of the Wild. Spectacle Rock also appears in Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, A Link to the Past, and A Link Between Worlds.\nGanon's Castle is usually shown to be Ganon's headquarters, and has acted as the battleground between him and Link in several games.\nThe Great Sea is the setting of The Wind Waker and Phantom Hourglass, formed after a deluge flooded Hyrule. Only a few mountaintops are still visible above the water, and these form the islands and archipelagos of the Great Sea. Due to the relatively small size of the many islands, the large expanses of ocean between each island require the player to use charts to navigate from island to island. On the islands of the Great Sea, local commerce is shown to be quite advanced. Most food is gathered from fishing and small farms, though there are also active merchant, salvage, and shipbuilding businesses.\nHyrule Castle is the home of Hyrule's royal family. The castle's first appearance was in A Link to the Past, the third game in the series. It is often a central area that Link must enter during his quest.\nKakariko Village is a village that first appears in A Link to the Past and has since reappeared in Ocarina of Time, Four Swords Adventures, Twilight Princess, A Link Between Worlds, and Breath of the Wild. Kakariko Village is often portrayed as a small, prosperous town that was originally founded by the Sheikah. In Twilight Princess, Shadow Beasts have kidnapped most of the villagers, making the town resemble a ghost town. The Hidden Village, another location in Twilight Princess, has signs that say \"Welcome to Old Kakarico\" in the Anglian language.\nLake Hylia is the largest freshwater lake in Hyrule. It commonly features collectible items and one or more dungeons. Link often encounters members of the Zora race at this location.\nThe Lost Woods is a large enchanted forest that appears in various titles, starting with The Legend of Zelda. Home to the Kokiri, Koroks and Fairies, its maze-like structure leads travels in circles unless they take the correct path through the forest. Rumors in the game state that those who become lost are turned into Stalfos. In several games, the Great Deku Tree and/or the Master Sword can be found in a shrine there.\nTemple of Time is the temple that houses the Master Sword in several games. The temple is also used to traverse time (most notably in Ocarina of Time), allowing the player to travel between the past and future. In some games, it serves as a dungeon level as well.\nSkyloft is a collection of large floating islands in Skyward Sword, created when the Goddess Hylia used the last of her power to raise what was left of the surviving Hylians along with a plot of land that was still free during the Great War with Demise. Below the clouds lies \"the Surface\". Found on the Surface are several locations visited in games that take place after the events of Skyward Sword: \"Faron Woods\" (shown in Twilight Princess and Breath of the Wild), \"Lake Floria\" (Breath of the Wild), \"Eldin\" (Twilight Princess and Breath of the Wild), \"Eldin Volcano\" (implied to be Death Mountain), and the arid \"Lanayru Desert\", which is seen as a fecund region in Twilight Princess and Breath of the Wild.\n\nObjects\nMaster Sword\nThe Master Sword, also known as \"The Blade of Evil's Bane\", the \"Sword of Resurrection\", or the \"sword that seals the darkness\" is a divine, magic sword that often acts as the ultimate weapon for the various Links in their quest to save Hyrule. It is one of the few weapons capable of harming Ganon and a key to the Sacred Realm. First introduced in A Link To The Past, it has the power to \"repel evil\", which enables it to overcome powerful dark magic and slay evil and demonic beings that otherwise cannot be harmed by conventional weaponry. In The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword, the blade is revealed to have originally began as the Goddess Sword, which had a sentient female avatar named Fi integrated into it. Near the end of the game, the Goddess Sword transforms into its current state after being infused with the Three Sacred Flames, with Fi's spirit form ceasing to be once the Master Sword absorbs the Demon King Demise's remains.The sword traditionally rests in a stone pedestal hidden in sacrosanct locations indigenous to Hyrule, such as the Temple of Time or the Lost Woods. Similar to Arthurian legend, the Master Sword can only be removed by someone who is worthy of wielding it. For example, In The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Link must have thirteen hearts to obtain the Master Sword. The sword is often not at full power, resulting in it needing to be \"recharged\" in some way, or have its power increased beyond its standard level to fight Ganon. There are some situations when the blade, already at full power, can be further improved; in A Link to the Past and A Link Between Worlds, it becomes a red, and later golden blade after it was tempered. Similarly, in The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, the sword's power is increased by the two Sols in the Palace of Twilight. The Wind Waker establishes that the sword needs the power of two sages praying to the gods to keep its powers, or else it will no longer be able to prevent an evil person from gaining the Triforce. In Breath of the Wild, the Master Sword is the only unbreakable weapon in the game, though if it is used too often the sword's power needs to be recharged, becoming temporarily unusable. The sword is located in the Korok Forest, which Link can only access by going through the Lost Woods.\nThe Master Sword is a double-edged one-handed sword. The blade cross-section is hexagonal with no fuller. On the flats of the blade near the hilt is a Triforce symbol, etched into the steel or emblazoned in gold. It has a purple or blue curved crossguard in the shape of a pair of wings with a small yellow jewel where it meets the hilt. The hilt is often padded red with a non-ornate blue pommel. Since The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, the Master Sword's blade glows white when it is revived by the sages in the mid-game. In Breath of the Wild, this glow represents the Master Sword's true power. Breath of the Wild is the first game to depict the blade showing signs of wear and rust, when Zelda places it in its pedestal in Korok Forest, though 100 years later the Master Sword is shown to have been restored to its undamaged state.\nNintendo Power listed the Master Sword as one of the best weapons in gaming, citing that it is more than just a powerful sword, but also integral to Link's adventures and development as a character.\n\nTriforce\nThe Triforce, also called the \"Power of the Gods\" and the \"Golden Triangle\", is a triangular sacred relic left behind by the three Golden Goddesses when they created Hyrule. It is made up of three smaller triangles known as the Triforce of Power, the Triforce of Wisdom, and the Triforce of Courage. These embody the essences of their respective goddesses, and bestow certain boons on their bearers. In most of its appearances, the Triforce or its pieces manifest as a marking on the hands of their bearers. These markings resonate when near each other, and the Triforce pieces can emerge from their bearers as a result.\nWhen united, the Triforce allows one who touches it to make a wish that usually lasts until they die or the wish is fulfilled. If the one who finds it does not possess a balance of the three virtues it represents, however, the pieces split into its three components and the finder is left with the one that represents the characteristic they value most; the other two pieces do likewise with two other characters \"chosen by destiny\". Ganon makes it his goal to obtain the Triforce in various games, often having a single piece himself (the Triforce of Power) that he uses to further his goals.\nThe Triforce of Power, which is positioned as the topmost of the three, holds the presence of Din, the goddess of Power, and radiates the physical and magical power of its bearer. It is associated with Ganon, who is power-hungry. The Triforce of Wisdom, positioned on the lower left, embodies the essence of Nayru, the goddess of Wisdom, and amplifies the wisdom and mystical powers of its bearer. It is associated with Princess Zelda, whose great wisdom brings peace and prosperity to Hyrule. The Triforce of Courage, positioned on the lower right, embodies the essence of Farore, the goddess of Courage, and seems to amplify the courage and adventuring skills of its bearer. It is associated with Link, who bravely defends Hyrule from Ganon and other malevolent forces.\n\nOther lands and worlds\nSeveral games in the series are set outside Hyrule, including Link's Awakening, set on Koholint Island; Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages, set in the countries of Holodrum and Labrynna, respectively;  Majora's Mask, is set in the parallel world of Termina; The Wind Waker and Phantom Hourglass, both set on the Great Sea, a flooded Hyrule (although a large portion of Phantom Hourglass takes place in the World of the Ocean King in another dimension); Spirit Tracks, set in New Hyrule; and Skyward Sword, set on Skyloft, a group of islands above the clouds (although part of the storyline of this last game does take place on an underdeveloped pre-Hyrule).\n\nLabrynna\nLabrynna is a country, once ruled by Queen Ambi, that first appeared in Oracle of Ages. The capital of Labrynna is Lynna City where Ambi's Palace used to stand. Notable landmarks include the Black Tower, the Forest of Time, Fairy's Woods, Talus Peaks, Rolling Ridge, Crescent Island, and Yoll Graveyard. Residents of Labryinna are predominantly humans, but also include Zora, Gorons, and Tokay.\n\nNew Hyrule\nNew Hyrule is a different land where a new kingdom was established after Hyrule was flooded in The Wind Waker. First appearing in Spirit Tracks, New Hyrule is composed of Forest, Snow, Sand, Fire, and Ocean realms. This place also home to the Tower of Spirits and the demons Malladus and Chancellor Cole.\n\nLorule\nLorule is a parallel world to Hyrule in A Link Between Worlds. It is similar to Hyrule in geography, features Lorulean counterparts of many people found in Hyrule, and is ruled by Princess Zelda's Lorulean counterpart, Princess Hilda. Like Hyrule, Lorule originally had its own Triforce and was the source of various conflicts. However, the Royal Family of Lorule decided to destroy the Triforce in an attempt to put an end to conflict, only to bring calamity to their world as a result. Desperate to save the kingdom and her people, Princess Hilda conspired with her servant Yuga to steal Hyrule's Triforce, unaware that Yuga wanted the Triforce for himself. Eventually Yuga is defeated by Link, and Hilda's former servant Ravio manages to show her the error of her ways. Ultimately Link and Zelda decide to forgive Hilda for her misguided actions and use the Triforce to restore the Lorulean Triforce, which in turn restores the land of Lorule.\n\nTermina\nTermina is a parallel world to Hyrule that serves as the main setting of Majora's Mask. Link falls into this world from a portal deep within the Lost Woods. The land has very similar geography to that of Hyrule, and many of its citizens have identical names and appearances to (although different personalities from) people in Hyrule. The land itself is split into four distinct regions, one for every compass direction, and each guarded by four giant deities: The swampy Woodfall, home of the Deku Scrubs, to the south; The icy Snowhead Mountains of the Gorons to the north; Great Bay, home of the Zora to the west; and the undead wastelands of Ikana Canyon to the east. Its capital, Clock Town, lies in the center.\n\nOthers\nSeveral other parallel worlds to Hyrule exist, such as the Twilight Realm, the World of the Ocean King, and the Dark World from Twilight Princess,  Phantom Hourglass, and A Link to the Past, respectively. Several other lands also exist beyond the kingdom. Triforce Heroes is set in Hytopia, a kingdom connected to Hyrule. Holodrum is the land in Oracle of Seasons\n\nRaces\nAncient Robots\nThe Ancient Robots are a prehistoric mechanical race that appear in Skyward Sword. Link encounters them in the third area of the game, Lanayru Desert. They were created by the Thunder Dragon Lanayru, but their land eventually became a barren desert while they rusted away. By using a Timeshift Stone to change the present to the past, they can be revived. The robots were designed to resemble ancient clay figures from Japanese history. Although the designers expressed concern about including advanced technology in Skyward Sword, they decided that they did not look out of place within the game world.\n\nDragon\nDragons are a recurring race that usually appear as benevolent guardians or powerful enemies. In Ocarina of Time, after becoming the King of Evil, Ganondorf resurrects the evil Goron-eating dragon Volvagia, who had terrorized the Goron people in the distant past before being defeated by Darunia's ancestor, who wielded the Megaton Hammer. When Ganondorf orders his minions to capture and feed the Gorons to Volvagia as a warning to his enemies, Darunia journeys to the Fire Temple to rescue his people and defeat Volvagia, but he is defeated because he could not locate the Megaton Hammer. However, Link manages to free the Gorons, slay Volvagia, and awaken Darunia as the Sage of Fire. In The Wind Waker, the Sky Spirit Valoo acts as the godlike dragon and the patron deity of the Rito tribe, providing them with his scales that allow them to grow wings. When Link arrives on Dragon Roost Island, he discovers that Gohma was tormenting Valoo, and defeats Gohma to obtain Din's Pearl. Valoo and the Rito later repay their debt to Link by rescuing him and Tetra from Ganondorf during their encounter with him in Forsaken Fortress. In Twilight Princess, Link encounters a species of malevolent draconic warriors called Aeralfos and the Twilit dragon Argorok, who is the boss of the City in the Sky. In Skyward Sword, Link is aided by the Three Dragons that guard the three regions of the Surface. Faron the Water Dragon rules over the Parella and protector of Faron Woods, Lake Floria, and the Ancient Cistern that holds Farore's Flame. Eldin the Fire Dragon guards Eldin Volcano. Lanayru the Thunder Dragon created the Ancient Robots and protects Lanayru Desert. Each dragon was entrusted with part of the Song of the Hero, which provides clues on the location of the Triforce. In Breath of the Wild, the three dragons Dinraal, Naydra, and Farosh can be found located around Hyrule, and the scales they drop can be used to access the three Shrines at the Spring of Wisdom, the Spring of Power, and the Spring of Courage.\n\nFairy\nFairies are magical creatures associated with nature and the Goddess Farore that appear as small, winged humanoids often obscured by light. Fairies tend to shy away from human settlements and are most often associated with the Lost Woods, but can be found hiding in many places throughout Hyrule. Fairy Fountains or Fairy Springs are special places that contain sparkling magical water and attract Fairies in large numbers. In most games in the series, fairies will heal Link if he manages to catch one and he can also put them in empty bottles to have them heal him later. If Link dies while he has a bottled fairy in his possession, the fairy will automatically resurrect him instead of receiving a Game Over.\nGreat Fairies are powerful, high ranking fairies that often watch over their smaller brethren. They use their magic to enchant Link's items into more powerful versions and in some games they can also teach Link various magic spells. In Ocarina of Time, the Kokiri form a symbiotic relationship with their Guardian Fairies, who act as constant companions and mentors. One of these is Navi, who serves as Link's sidekick and aids Link in learning about the world outside Kokiri Forest. Another Guardian Fairy is Tatl from Majora's Mask who was a friend of the Skull Kid until he betrayed her and her brother Tael. In Phantom Hourglass, Link's guardian fairy is Ciela, who is eventually joined by two more fairies, Leaf and Neri. In some of the games, such as The Minish Cap, players will be tested of their honesty and if they are, fairies give them gifts and upgrades.\nIn Breath of the Wild, Fairies can be found around the Springs of the four Great Fairies when Link has no more than three currently in his inventory (Fairies being held are excluded from the count). Though rare, Link can also find fairies drifting around any random area in Hyrule. There is also a small chance to find a fairy by cutting grass in any field in Hyrule.\n\nGerudo\nThe Gerudo are a race of human warrior-thieves that are prominently featured in the history and lore of Hyrule. The Gerudo tribe is indigenous to the harsh Gerudo Desert that bears their name, and they live in the Gerudo Valley and within the Gerudo Fortress. Physical Gerudo traits typically include scarlet hair, aquiline noses, gold or green eyes, round or pointed ears, and tanned or bronzed skin. Like the Amazons, the race consists entirely of women, apart from a single Gerudo male who is born every century. The male is lawfully crowned king of the tribe, and is even worshipped like a God king. When there is no male present to be king, leadership is entrusted to female chiefs. Ganondorf, the main antagonist of the series, is king of the Gerudo. He has been referred to as The Demon King, the King of Thieves, and the King of Darkness. In The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time he is the surrogate son of the twin Gerudo witch sisters Kotake and Koume. The Gerudo appear as pirates in The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, where they live in the ocean at Great Bay. In The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, they are traders and merchants. As men are not permitted in Gerudo Town, Link has to crossdress as a female to enter.\n\nGoron\nThe Goron are a race of mountain-dwelling rock people who first appeared in Ocarina of Time. They have the ability to roll along the ground and have a round rock-like physical appearance. Goron culture revolves around brotherhood and strength, usually referring to each other and those they deem strong as \"Brother\" or \"Big Brother\". Gorons show high regard for individuals who display great strength and bravery and enjoy matching their strength with others in competition such as sumo wrestling and racing. They live in tribes headed by a patriarch, such as Darunia in Ocarina of Time. Mainly inhabiting mountainous areas, such as Death Mountain, Gorons are resistant to intense heat and lava and they also consume rocks and minerals, which they mine from the earth.\n\nHylian\nHylians are an elf-like race of humans that make up the predominant population of Hyrule, in which they established an organized civilization resembling that of medieval Europe. They were created as the first race of Hyrule by the goddess Hylia, the main fictional deity of the series, who is subsequently reincarnated as Princess Zelda in mortal form. They are born with magic-infused blood said to be a gift from the goddesses that grants them psychic powers and magical skill. Their long pointed ears are said to allow them to hear messages sent by the gods. The main characters, Link and Princess Zelda are prominent characters of this race in all games of the series. In Skyward Sword, Hylians live on a floating island known as Skyloft and are accompanied by bird-like creatures called Loftwings. Hylians are a fairly diverse species, having variations in skin, hair and eye colour. Due to repeated attacks from enemies, such as Ganon, large Hylian armies exist to protect the kingdom of Hyrule. In Skyward Sword, Link trains as a knight in the Knight Academy and appears again as a knight for the Kingdom of Hyrule in Breath of the Wild.\n\nKokiri\nThe Kokiri are a pixie-like race who inhabit the Kokiri Forest. They are one of two races who branched from the Hylians, with the other being the Wind Tribe. This was because they wanted to live a more natural life as Hyrule continued to industrialize. They are shielded by the Great Deku Tree who considers them to be his children, and each receives a small fairy that is their lifelong friend, guardian, and teacher. They do not age once they grow up into kids thanks to the Deku Tree's power. Cautious and secretive, the Kokiri believe, with reason, that they will die if they leave the forest. It is also said that if they wander too deep into the forest, they will turn into a Skull Kid.\nA Kokiri named Saria is the Sage of the Forest. Another Kokiri, Fado, is the first Sage of Wind in The Wind Waker, but he is killed prior to the events of the game, leaving the player to interact with his spirit and locate his successor, the Korok Makar. Link was raised as a Kokiri in Ocarina of Time, but was not born to them, as his Hylian mother entrusted him to the Great Deku Tree when he was an infant.\n\nKoroks\nThe Koroks are plant-like beings that first appeared in The Wind Waker. They are said to have been transformed from the Kokiri after the Great Flood. They are small creatures with wood-like bodies and masks made from leaves. They are very light, which allows them to travel by using sprouts as propellers. They leave their home, the \"Forest Haven\", to plant seeds from the Great Deku Tree all over the world, and return once a year to hold a ceremony and obtain more seeds. In Breath of the Wild, Koroks can be found all over Hyrule. The player must solve puzzles to get Korok Seeds from them. Once players retrieve Korok Seeds from Koroks, they can trade them with Hestu, a large Korok, for more inventory slots for weapons, shields, and bows. Koroks are difficult to find, despite being so numerous and are best protected in Korok Forest, a hidden location in the Lost Woods.\n\nOocca\nThe Oocca  are a race of birds with long necks and human-like faces that appear in Twilight Princess. They live in the \"City in the Sky\", an airborne city that acts as the seventh dungeon in Twilight Princess. A female Oocca named Ooccoo can warp the player back to the entrance of the game's dungeons. Ooccoo's son, Ooccoo Jr, warps the player to Ooccoo's location. In Twilight Princess, these creatures are mentioned to be closer to the gods than the Hylians. Some in Hyrule theorise that the Oocca actually evolved into the Hylians. It is supposed that they created Hylians and created a city in the sky for them to live in. In Twilight Princess, Link reaches this city by launching himself out of an enormous cannon. Ooccoo has also appeared in other Nintendo games, such as Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Hyrule Warriors.\n\nMinish\nMinish, referred to in their native language as Picori, are small humanoid sprites no bigger than a human thumb that live in secret. They are only visible to children and tend to live in forests, but also appear inside of buildings and holes in and around various spots of Hyrule. There are three variations of the Minish, which can be distinguished by their attire: Forest Minish, Town Minish and Mountain Minish. They first appear in The Minish Cap. Most Minish are helpful, and like to hide valuable objects for others to find, although one Picori, Vaati became evil after becoming obsessed with human nature.\n\nRito\nThe Rito are a race of raptor-like humanoids who debuted in The Wind Waker. They evolved from the Zora species. In that game, they lived on Dragon Roost Island, an island on the Great Sea. They have a tribal elder and elaborately dressed guards. In The Wind Waker, Rito are born without wings, and instead, must visit their guardian, the Sky Spirit, Valoo, in a coming-of-age ceremony to receive one of his scales, which enables them to grow wings. Throughout a young Rito's childhood, he or she is called a Fledgling and is flightless without any wings. After a child reaches a certain age they can receive their wings after they retrieve a scale from the dragon Valoo. Most Rito can fly over a great distance and hover in place, but some have trouble flying for long periods of time. In Breath of the Wild, the Rito reside in the Hebra region in northwest Hyrule and tolerate cold climates. These Rito feature a much more prominent avian design that includes wings and are able to fly using updrafts. Prominent Rito characters include Revali, the Rito Champion, and Kass, a wandering minstrel who displays the Rito's appreciation of music through song.\n\nSheikah\nThe Sheikah are ancient and mysterious ninja-like warriors who are commonly distinguished by their red eyes and white hair. The most prominent recurring representative of the Sheikah is Zelda's nursemaid and bodyguard Impa. They bear a physical resemblance to Hylians, but are a completely different race, having great technological prowess. Physically they are extremely capable, able to run and jump better than other Hyruleans. They are also some of the most potent magic-wielders in Hyrule. The Sheikah have a divinely ordained role to protect the Hyrule Royal Family. Their symbol, the Eye of the Sheikah, which is depicted as a single eye with three triangles above and a teardrop beneath, is commonly seen in the series, even in games where the Sheikah are not present. In Breath of the Wild, examples of the advanced technology created by the Sheikah can be found in the hidden structures around Hyrule and in the form of Link's Sheikah Slate.\n\nTwili\nTwili are a race that exist in the Twilight Realm and appear in Twilight Princess. The Twili come from a group referred to as the Interlopers, who used extraordinary magic to dominate a war between Hylians for the Triforce and the Sacred Realm. Seeing this, the Golden Goddesses ordered the Light Spirits to seal their magic in the Fused Shadow; the Interlopers were then banished to the Twilight Realm, a dark mirror world of Hyrule, where they adapted and evolved into the Twili. The most prominent members of their race is Midna the Twilight Princess and Zant. He overthrew Midna with Ganondorf's help in order to become king of the Twilight.\n\nZora\nThe Zora are a race of aquatic piscine humanoids that appear in nearly every game of the series. They are an aquatic race that inhabit Zora's Domain or Lake Hylia. In the original game and Link to the Past, Zora were enemies that attacked Link from the water with projectiles, though the giant Zora King sells Link a pair of flippers in A Link to the Past, allowing him to swim and to use the network of whirlpools that link far corners of Hyrule. By Ocarina of Time, their role in most stories had changed to a neutral or friendly race. Zora government is monarchical, either ruled by a king, with examples being King Dorephan or King Zora De Bon XVI, or queen, such as Queen Oren or Queen Rutela. Two different branches exist: \"River Zora\" are more violent and can shoot fire, while \"Sea Zora\" are generally passive. Zora have extraordinarily long lifespans and lay eggs to reproduce. Zora eggs need to be kept in cold, clean water to develop healthily, and every egg from the same clutch must be kept together for them to hatch. Newborn Zora have the appearance of a tadpole.\n\nEnemies\nThe appearance of some creatures varies across different titles of the series.\n\nArmos are animated statues built to guard ancient ruins that come to life and attack when disturbed. The Minish Cap features them as guards created by the Wind Tribe. They first appeared in The Legend of Zelda.\nBeamos like Armos are statues built to guard ancient ruins. Beamos sit stationary scanning the room with a single rotating \"eye\". When they spot an intruder they fire off a high powered laser that tracks the target some distance. They first appeared in A Link to the Past.\nBiri and Bari are electrified jellyfish that can hover in the air. Striking them with a metal weapon causes Link to be electrocuted. They often split into smaller duplicates after being attacked.\nBlade Traps: Indestructible metallic devices armed with spikes. Some sense intruders and fly towards them, while others move in a set pattern. They first appeared in The Legend of Zelda.\nBokoblins are a race of goblin-like creatures, that first appeared in The Wind Waker. Bokoblins come in a variety of colors. They often appear as standard enemies and wield boko sticks, machetes and clubs. Though their appearance varies from game to game, the one thing that remains consistent is they wear loincloths with a single skull. In Twilight Princess, they are less common and their role as standard enemies is largely taken over by the Bulblins. In Skyward Sword, Bokoblins are common monsters that serve the Demon Tribe, under Demon Lord Ghirahim and the Demon King Demise. The game also introduces Technoblins and Cursed Bokoblins, undead Bokoblins that can curse Link. In Breath of the Wild, Bokoblins are low-level, comical enemies that commonly appear across Hyrule living in camps.\nBubbles, also known as Anti-Fairies or Whisps, are dark fairies that take the form of giant flaming skulls. They can place curses on their victims, the color of their flame denoting the abilities they possess. For example, if a Blue Bubble bites Link he will be temporarily unable to draw his sword. In some games Link can use Magic Powder to turn Bubbles into healing fairies. They first appeared in The Legend of Zelda.\nBuzz Blobs are electrical slime creatures with tapering bodies. They are passive, but their bodies carry an electrical charge that will shock Link should he touch one. Buzz Blobs deal damage when struck with metal weapons such as swords, with the exception of the Golden Sword, requiring the use of ranged weapons, which can either defeat them instantly or stun them, leaving them vulnerable to sword strikes.\nChuChus are jelly-like creatures with squat, translucent bodies, stalk-eyes, and a smiling mouth that have a variety of colors. In The Wind Waker their appearance was changed to upright, opaque bodies and vibrantly colored faces. They first appeared by that name in Majora's Mask, but two similar blob-type enemies were in the original The Legend of Zelda named \"Bit\" and \"Bot\", and a Bot became two Bits when Link slashed it, similar to the behavior of ChuChus in newer titles. Modern ChuChus come in Green, Red (the two most common colors), Yellow, Blue and dark Purple. They aggressively attack anything that invades their territory by tackling it, but will hide in puddles on the ground if no one is close. They mostly move by bouncing around, though the Green, Yellow and Blue ChuChus will occasionally melt and turn into small invincible puddles, and proceed to move around in their puddle forms until they can get close to Link, or until Link uses an item such as his Boomerang to stun and coax them out of their puddles. In Twilight Princess, after one is killed, Link can use their puddles as potions or lantern fuel, depending on the type of ChuChu. In Skyward Sword, ChuChus come in a variety of colors: Green, red (fire), blue (underwater), and yellow (electricity). ChuChus' sizes also vary a lot, depending on their color. The smallest can be defeated with one sword strike, the medium-sized need to be hit multiple times, and the largest ones can be split into two smaller ones with a vertical slash. In Breath of the Wild, ChuChus came in four different forms, normal, fire, ice, and electric. They come in a big, medium, or small size. They will jump around and sometimes pounce at Link. If they charge at Link, they will lose their element and become dark and faded, but retain their color. They are vulnerable at this point to attack. They will try to regain their elemental power if left for too long without being killed. Once they are defeated, they will drop ChuChu jelly, which will stay in the element they are, unless an elemental arrow or weapon is used on it to change the element.\nCuccos are a type of chicken commonly domesticated for their eggs and meat. Although Hylian Cuccos strongly resemble real-life chickens they differ in several key ways. In most games they are strong enough to glide while carrying the weight of an adult man, allowing Link to use them to glide to otherwise unreachable areas. Some breeds of Cucco, like blue and gold Cuccos can even outright fly while being held. Normally docile, Cuccos will become angry if the player attacks them repeatedly and crow to summon a flock of Cuccos to attack the aggressor until he or she dies or leaves the area or enters a building. Cuccos first appeared in A Link to the Past. They mostly come in white, although The Minish Cap had gold Cuccos and Twilight Princess had black, brown, golden and grey variants as well. In Ocarina of Time, there was a single blue Cucco that was used in a trading sequence.\nDarknuts are large armored knights armed with swords and shields. They first appeared in The Legend of Zelda, but are recurring foes that appear in Twilight Princess and other games.\nDeku are wooden plant-like creatures introduced in Ocarina of Time that appear mostly in the overworld and dungeons. Deku are small creatures that have leaves sprouting out from their heads, red glowing eyes and tube-like mouths that can shoot Deku Nuts. They can fly by using large leaves to glide, and some can use the leaves on their head to fly indefinitely after taking off from a Deku Flower. There are four types of Deku depicted in the series: Deku Scrubs, Mad Scrubs, Business Scrubs, and Royal Scrubs.\nDeku Babas are Venus fly trap-like carnivorous plants, typically found. They spend much of their time shrunk down springing from the ground whenever their roots detect the footsteps of potential prey. They first appeared in Ocarina of Time.\nDodongos are fire-breathing reptilian dinosaurs that resemble gigantic iguanas. They move slowly, protected by their thick scales but are incredibly aggressive, eating anything that comes within reach of their mouths. Baby Dodongos are born limbless and spend much of their time buried underground and when attacked they explode. Big Dodongos, which are larger versions of normal Dodongos also appear. A King Dodongo appears as a boss in Ocarina of Time. They first appeared in The Legend of Zelda.\nFloormasters and Wallmasters are ghostly manifestations of giant hands that drag adventurers back to the entrance of a dungeon. Floormasters roam around the room and are visible at all times, while Wallmasters hide on the ceiling out of sight. Also, Floormasters split up into smaller versions when the original is attacked, whereas Wallmasters do not. Wallmasters first appeared in The Legend of Zelda while Floormasters first appeared in Ocarina of Time. Floormasters appeared in The Wind Waker as a spectral arm and hand that will transport Link to a jail-like holding area if he is caught. They do not split up when attacked.\nGargoyles are statues that appear in The Legend of Zelda and The Adventure of Link.  They shoot fireballs at Link in the underground dungeons.\nGibdos are undead creatures wrapped like mummies. They resemble ReDeads in regards to their slow and zombie-like movement; in some games, setting a Gibdo's bandages alight will reveal a Stalfos or a ReDead underneath. In Majora's Mask, Link can use the Gibdo Mask to communicate with them. They first appeared in The Legend of Zelda.\nGohma are recurring boss monsters which typically resemble giant arthropods with a single eye. The eye serves as their weak point.\nHinox are a recurring enemy and sub-boss in the Legend of Zelda series. The Hinox's single eye is its most vulnerable place, dealing the most damage to it when hit. They are cyclops-like ogres and have appeared in A Link to the Past, Link\u2019s Awakening, Four Swords Adventures, Phantom Hourglass, A Link Between Worlds, Tri Force Heroes and most recently, Breath of the Wild. In Breath of the Wild, Hinoxs can be either red, blue or black, depending on their strength. They are the largest monster found within the game and will uproot nearby trees to use as weapons against the player if provoked. Once defeated, they will drop miscellaneous food, Hinox toenails, Hinox guts, and Hinox teeth. One of the Shrine Quests called \u2018The Three Giant Brothers\u2019 in Breath of the Wild requires the player to beat three Hinox known as the Youngest, Middle and Oldest Kin, all of whom can be found around Mount Taran(but the fighting process can be skipped if you're stealthy enough).\nStalnox are animated versions of Hinox that appear in Breath of the Wild. Like Stalmoblins or Stalkoblins, they are just as powerful as their living counterparts, however attacking the eye of a Stalnox can cause it to fall out of its socket, allowing the player to attack it and deal a significant amount of damage before the Stalnox retrieves and replaces it. In order to obtain the Hylian Shield, the player must defeat the Stalnox kept within the lockup of Hyrule Castle.\nIron Knuckles are heavily armored knights with axes. While they are even slower than the Darknuts, they are the most powerful enemies in their games as they can take four hearts from Link with just one hit and because of that they are often used to guard treasures. They first appeared in The Adventure of Link.\nKeese are bat monsters that often lurk in dark places such as caves, waiting to dive bomb unwary travelers attempting to bite off chunks of flesh. Some Keese have the ability to pick up elements they fly through and there are fire, ice, cursed, and electric variants. They first appeared in The Legend of Zelda.\nLeevers are conical cactus-like monsters that primarily live in sandy areas, such as deserts and beaches. They hide beneath the sand, burrowing to the top to attack in ambush when they sense the footsteps of an intruder. Leevers attack by spinning rapidly and slamming their thorny bodies into their target. They first appeared in The Legend of Zelda.\nLike Likes are yellowish cylindrical monsters that can suck in creatures as large as humans and consume items they carry. They are known for swallowing the shields and tunics that Link uses. Like Likes dissolve into a puddle when killed, leaving the stolen items. They first appeared in The Legend of Zelda, where they swallow the magical shield, but do not return it upon being killed.\nLizalfos: are swift and cunning anthropomorphic lizards that often attack in pairs and can parry and dodge oncoming attacks. Stronger Dinolfos are capable of breathing fire, while winged Aeralfos attack from the air. They first appeared in The Adventure of Link. In The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Lizalfos can throw weapons and dash toward their target, throwing off any archer ( aka Link) that tries to shoot them. Lizalfos can drop their body parts and in Silver and Gold Lizalfos, drop gems.\nLynels are large, strong centaur-like creatures with a head of a lion and horns that first appeared in The Legend of Zelda. This creature has multiple variations consisting of red, blue, white, and silver, with each color denoting the Lynel's strength. White and silver Lynels appear only in Breath of the Wild. In the game, Lynels are extremely powerful foes that can be found in many locations, with white Lynels appearing mostly in colder climates such as the Gerudo Highlands and the N. Tabantha Snowfield. The only Lynel that does not scale up to a more powerful variant is the Lynel located northeast of Zora's domain at Shatterback Point, due to its involvement in several quests. Stronger gold Lynels are included in Oracle of Seasons and in downloadable content for Breath of the Wild. In Breath of the Wild, the strongest variants can drop Star Fragments as well as gems and monster parts.\nMoblins are orc-like monsters that serve as Ganon's footsoldiers. In The Legend of Zelda and The Adventure of Link, Moblins resembled bulldogs, but are pig-like in more recent games. They are sometimes accompanied by Pig Warriors, monsters with the same basic form but more porcine characteristics. Both types commonly wield spears, swords, bows, or occasionally massive clubs. They are one of the most common enemies within the games they appear, and are considered \"mighty\", but also \"dumb\". They are described as greedy, self-possessed creatures, and the major antagonist will commonly use them as mercenaries or summoned monsters. Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons feature a larger Moblin known as the Great Moblin, who terrorizes Holodrum and Labrynna. In The Wind Waker, which introduces two additional smaller creatures, impish Bokoblins and Miniblins, rodent-like beasts who carry pitchforks. In Spirit Tracks, Miniblins were pirates usually led by a \"Big Blin\", a larger, muscled variation that wields a spiked club. In Skyward Sword, they are depicted as fatter and will use their weight in a final attempt to crush Link before dying. In Breath of the Wild, they are taller and lankier and revealed that they are carnivorous and require a diet of meat and fish to maintain their bulky frames. Like Bokoblins, Lizalfos, and Lynels, they have color variants that denote their strength, the weakest being red and the strongest being silver (gold in Master Mode). They drop monster parts in all variants, the higher the tier, the more parts, which in turn can be sold for rupees or Mon. The Silver and Gold Moblins can also drop precious gems for rupees.\nStalmoblins are the animated skeletons of Moblins that appear in Breath of the Wild. Like Stalkoblins, their skeletons continue to reanimate as long as a Stalmoblin skull is present. While just as powerful as their living counterparts, they are much easier to defeat by focusing on destroying their skulls.\nNejirons are creatures evolved to resemble rolling Gorons, despite having no biological relation. This is to fool their prey, as Gorons are generally peaceful. They are comprised partly of gunpowder, evidenced by their potent odour of it, and consequently explode upon being hit.\nOctoroks are octopus monsters that have appeared in almost every Legend of Zelda game (except for Twilight Princess). Octoroks produce rocks within their body that they can fire from their snout via compressed air with the force of a musket shot. Some species of Octorok are land-dwelling while others are mostly aquatic. Big Octos are a very large ocean-dwelling breed sometimes known to attack ships. They first appeared in The Legend of Zelda.\nPeahats are flying plants that soar through the skies on sharp helicopter-like leaves. Some Peahats are small while others can grow to massive sizes. In Twilight Princess, smaller Peahats were passive creatures rather than enemies and could be used as a transportation method via the Clawshot. They first appeared in The Legend of Zelda.\nPoes are lantern-carrying ghosts formed from concentrated hatred toward the living that freely roam graveyards and other haunted locales. They always carry their signature lanterns. In some editions, they can go invisible when Link is doing a certain action or in a certain form. They first appeared in The Legend of Zelda.\nPols Voice are strange ghost-like creatures with large rabbit ears and whiskers that hop about in an erratic pattern. A lamprey-like mouth is hidden under their bodies. Pols Voice hate loud noises so explosive weapons are most effective but in some games they can also be damaged by musical instruments. They first appeared in The Legend of Zelda.\nReDeads are undead creatures resembling zombies with dark brown skin and flat mask-like faces that can paralyze enemies with a scream, and cling to them to drain health away. They first appeared in Ocarina of Time.\nSkulltulas are giant spiders, named for the bony plate in the shape of a human skull that forms their carapace. They are most commonly found in dark places, such as forests, caves, and dungeons but can also sometimes be found in towns at night. Skulltulas and Giant Skulltulas hang from ceiling surfaces, suspended by a strand of silk waiting to drop on unwary prey. Smaller Skulltulas called Skullwalltulas are commonly encountered on climbable surfaces and will attempt to bite Link if he doesn't first shoot them down. Rare Golden Skulltulas are associated with the \"Curse of Skulltula\" and must killed to break the curse.\nStalchild are smaller forms of the Stalfos. Like Stalfos they are the vengeful spirits of dead soldiers. They only appear on the overworld at night and spawn endlessly, but retreat as soon as the sun rises. Unlike Stalfos, they do not carry any weapons, and instead swipe at their target with long, bloody claws. In Ocarina of Time there is an easter egg where after a certain number is defeated, a larger one appears. They make their debut in Ocarina of Time.\nStalfos are animated skeletons mostly from the remains of dead warriors who still have a strong will to fight, and serve evil powers such as Ganon or Vaati. In Ocarina of Time, by using the Mask of Truth, the player learns from a Gossip Stone that humans that get lost while in the Lost Woods will become Stalfos. They first appeared in The Legend of Zelda.\nTektites are cyclopean four-legged insectoid creatures who use their powerful legs to leap upon and attack prey. Blue Tektites can walk on water, and both Blue and Red Tektites can jump up cliffs. They first appeared in The Legend of Zelda.\nWizzrobes are magician-like creatures that wear wizard robes and often use fire and ice magic. They are what most reincarnated wizards become. In The Wind Waker, they can also summon other enemies and wear toucan-like or bird-like masks and headdresses. They first appeared in The Legend of Zelda. Breath of the Wild introduced elemental Wizzrobes, who use various magical Rods to summon elemental attacks, elemental enemies and even change the weather accordingly. The regular types are the Fire, Electric and Ice Wizzrobes, however each has a more powerful variant. These are known as Meteo and Thunder Wizzrobes, and Blizzrobes respectively. All have the same appearance of a small, black imp with a large cloak; this cloak has a long, pointed hood to make them seem larger.\n\nReception\nIn their January 2010 issue, Nintendo Power listed Hyrule as one of the greatest Nintendo locations, citing the vast number of areas to explore, as well as referencing players' first experiences with the Lost Woods and Death Mountain as highlights of the players' adventures. Yannick LeJacq writing for Kotaku commented, \" Hyrule is one of the most iconic settings in the history of video games. The Legend of Zelda players have been poring over it in one way or another for almost 30 years now.\" Christian Donlan of Eurogamer noted the similarity and influence that Hyrule had on Dark Souls, comparing both kingdoms by commenting, \"In the original Legend of Zelda, however, Hyrule feels, well, a bit more like Lordran - a place of scarred earth and wasteland, parched and rugged and filled with horrible creatures that erupt from the sands or move in staggering hops.\"Polygon's Jeremy Parish remarked on the impact that Hyrule and it's centrepiece Hyrule Field had on gamers in Ocarina of Time. He commented, \"Open game worlds existed before Ocarina of Time. And in truth, Ocarina\u2019s rendition of Hyrule isn\u2019t even really all that open. But the game explored the relationship between its environments, the camera's 3D perspective and Link's place in it all to create a realm that felt far more like a real location than the game worlds that had come before it.\" Destructoid also noted Hyrule's impact in Ocarina of Time, saying \"there was nothing else like it before 1998\" and continued, \"The awesome thing about Hyrule is that I can honestly see a place like it existing in our world. It's not just some fantasy, flashy place like you'd find in the Star Wars universe. It's meant to look like the real world, and Miyamoto achieved that goal in a way no one would have expected without actually seeing it first.\"The open world of Hyrule in Breath of the Wild has received praise for its design. Noelle Warner of Destructoid ranked all of the settlements in Breath of the Wild and chose Tarrey Town as the favourite location, because players must build it from the ground up, making it one of the longest side quests in the game. Kate Gray writing for The Guardian was impressed by the beauty and large scale of the game world, noting that, \"The greens of the open plains contrast with the dark black of Death Mountain, which is streaked with orange lava on the distant horizon.\" She also commented on the, \"range of quiet, clever techniques designed to help players navigate the environment.\" Andrew Webster of The Verge responded positively to the grandness of the game's massive open world stating, \"The scale could have been daunting, but the joy of discovery and the satisfaction that comes from finding your own way make it inviting instead.\"Senior editor Caty McCarthy of USgamer ranked the in-game map of A Link to the Past as the best video game map, describing it as \"perfect\" world design in terms of the way it integrates with the gameplay. IGN ranked Hyrule as the sixth greatest game world, commenting, \"few game worlds manage to leave as indelible an impression on the collective gaming subconscious as Zelda has. For that alone it ranks up there as one of the best, most fully realized worlds in all of gaming.\" In 2021, Evan Narcisse of Kotaku listed Hyrule as one of the richest sci-fi and fantasy worlds in video games.\n\nSee also\nCharacters in The Legend of Zelda series\n\nNotes\n\n\n== References ==",
    "Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity": "Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity is a hack-and-slash video game developed by Omega Force. It was published by Koei Tecmo in Japan and by Nintendo internationally for the Nintendo Switch console in 2020. In the story, set 100 years before the events of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Link and Princess Zelda must gather allies across Hyrule to fend off forces led by the evil Calamity Ganon, who is attempting to revive himself and destroy the kingdom.\nLike the original Hyrule Warriors (2014), Age of Calamity is a crossover mixing the world and characters of Nintendo's Legend of Zelda series with the gameplay of Koei Tecmo's Dynasty Warriors series. Upon release, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity received positive reviews for its gameplay, varied character playstyles, amount of content, visuals, soundtrack, characterization, and expansion of the Breath of the Wild setting. However, some criticized the technical performance, chiefly its inconsistent frame rate, and the story drew mixed responses, particularly the use of time travel elements. Age of Calamity shipped over 3 million copies worldwide in its first four days, making it the best-selling game in the entire Warriors franchise.\n\nGameplay\nLike the previous Hyrule Warriors game, Age of Calamity mixes the hack-and-slash gameplay of Koei Tecmo's Dynasty Warriors franchise with the characters, locations, and other elements from Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda series. The basic gameplay is participating in large-scale battles against enemies, while also completing objectives and taking strategic actions such as capturing bases and commanding troops.In addition to retaining the combat, material crafting, and weapon-upgrade systems from Hyrule Warriors, the game incorporates environmental puzzle solving and the use of the Sheikah Slate tool and paraglider from Breath of the Wild. Players can upgrade their characters, complete missions and challenges, use resources to access new areas, build weapons, and cook foods that can be used as buffs. Weapons in this game are invulnerable and will not break over time, unlike in Breath of the Wild. The game's map is similar to the one for Breath of the Wild. Players can choose stages from it and use the Sheikah Tower to explore between regions. The game features 18 playable characters; 14 are obtained via progression in the main story, while four can be unlocked by completing various side quests. Besides the characters, players are also able to control the gigantic Divine Beasts to destroy large numbers of enemies.The game also features compatibility with Nintendo's Amiibo figures, with the figures of the Four Champions relaunching alongside the game.\n\nPlot\nDuring the Great Calamity, a small Guardian awakens within Hyrule Castle. It escapes the destruction through a time portal but is followed by a portion of Calamity's Ganon's Malice. Arriving in an alternate timeline before the Calamity began, the Guardian is reactivated by Link and Impa during a battle. They take it to engineers Purah and Robbie for study and learn that it came from a future in which Ganon reawakens and destroys Hyrule. To prevent this, King Rhoam assembles four pilots for the recently-discovered Divine Beasts \u2013 Mipha, Daruk, Urbosa, and Revali \u2013 and commands them, Link, and Zelda to find the Master Sword in Korok Forest.\nThe Champions encounter the dark prophet Astor, who seeks to revive and control Calamity Ganon, corrupting the Forest, but Link draws the Master Sword and forces him to withdraw. Purah's research reveals the presence of Sheikah transport towers hidden underground, and the Champions reactivate them and use them to lead a preemptive strike on the Yiga Clan's hideout in Gerudo Desert. Learning from the Guardian's records that Calamity Ganon will return on Zelda's seventeenth birthday, King Rhoam sends her to train in hopes of awakening her sealing magic in time and deploys the Divine Beasts to prepare for the Calamity's impending return.\nRobbie and Purah are captured by Yiga spies while restoring the Guardian's memory, but it escapes with the Sheikah Slate and delivers it to Zelda just as the Calamity arrives. The Champions are ambushed in their Divine Beasts by Calamity Ganon's Blights and King Rhoam seemingly sacrifices himself as Link, Zelda, and Impa escape Hyrule Castle. The Guardian summons Sidon, Yunobo, Riju, and Teba from the original timeline to assist Mipha, Daruk, Urbosa, and Revali, respectively, buying Link enough time to destroy the Blights. With the Champions saved and the Divine Beasts restored, they begin to clear the way to Hyrule Castle. To stop the timeline from changing, Astor kills many of the Yiga Clan and uses their life force to resurrect the four Blights. Link is cornered by the revived Blights, but Zelda finally awakens her sealing magic to save him, forcing Astor to retreat. The remnants of the Yiga Clan defect to Zelda's side, and the group also discovers that King Rhoam survived.\nAfter Zelda and King Rhoam reconcile, Purah uses the Sheikah towers to transport all their allies to Hyrule Castle for a full-scale assault against Calamity Ganon. Although the Divine Beasts weaken Ganon's spirit form, Astor arrives with Harbinger Ganon, the small Guardian from the current timeline infected with the Malice from the original timeline. After being defeated by Link, Zelda, and the Champions, Astor is consumed by Harbinger Ganon, who transforms into Calamity Ganon. Calamity Ganon corrupts the little Guardian and turns it against the group, forcing them to destroy it. Upon its defeat, Zelda remembers she activated the little Guardian as a child and named it Terrako, but Rhoam took it away so she would focus on her training. Zelda and her allies confront Calamity Ganon but are unable to damage him until Terrako uses the last of its strength to self-destruct, weakening Calamity Ganon. Now vulnerable, Calamity Ganon is defeated by Link, and Zelda uses her power to permanently seal him away. The future heroes are returned to their timeline while Link, Zelda, and their allies look out at the now peaceful Hyrule. In a secret ending, Purah and Robbie repair Terrako, reuniting Zelda with her friend.\n\nDevelopment\nAge of Calamity was revealed in a trailer that was released on September 8, 2020, presented by Zelda series producer Eiji Aonuma and Koei Tecmo producer Yosuke Hayashi. The game features the same art assets as Breath of the Wild, but uses the more combat-focused gameplay style of the previous Hyrule Warriors game. More information was revealed at the Tokyo Game Show on September 26.The game came into fruition when Breath of the Wild's director Hidemaro Fujibayashi and art director Satoru Takizawa pitched the idea to Aonuma, who liked the idea and after discussions. Aonuma then approached Hayashi, a producer from Koei Tecmo, to make a new Hyrule Warriors about the events of the Great Calamity, which were mentioned but not properly shown in Breath of the Wild. Aonuma felt that the battles would complement well with the style of a Warriors game. Nintendo's Zelda developers worked more closely with the development team at Koei Tecmo than on Hyrule Warriors, providing advisement and assistance with gameplay, graphics, world, and dialogue.During Nintendo Treehouse Live gameplay presentation on October 7, Nintendo stated that the game will explore more backstories and relationships between characters, aspects that were not thoroughly examined in Breath of the Wild. At the end of that month, the demo became available to download from the Nintendo eShop, which includes the first chapter of the game. Kotaku noted from the demo that the game felt more connected to Breath of the Wild than to a Warriors title.\n\nDownloadable content\nIn a February 2021 Nintendo Direct stream, the \"Expansion Pass\" featuring downloadable content (DLC) for the game was announced. A purchase bonus was made available on May 28, 2021, featuring a new weapon and costume for Link. The costume is a prototype of ancient guardian armor and the weapon is a prototype of an ancient guardian sword. The first wave of content, titled \"Pulse of the Ancients,\" was released on June 18, 2021 and features an additional playable character (Battle-Tested Guardian), new weapon types (the Flail for Link and the Master Cycle for Zelda), new challenges in the Royal Ancient Lab, and newly-added challenging enemies. The second wave of content, titled \"Guardian of Remembrance,\" was released on October 29, 2021 and adds new story stages set during the events of the main game. \"Guardian of Remembrance\" also adds new battle skills for existing characters, and two additional characters: Purah and Robbie, who function as a single unit, and Sooga.\n\nReception\nCritical response\nAge of Calamity holds a score of 78 out of 100 on review aggregator Metacritic, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".Four reviewers for Famitsu gave the game a total score of 36/40, the second-highest score for a 2020 Nintendo Switch game at that point of the year (with Animal Crossing: New Horizons receiving 38/40 in March of the same year). TJ Denzer of Shacknews gave the game a 9/10 rating, giving high praise to the gameplay, differences between character playstyles, and story; they called Age of Calamity \"the most fleshed out and well-crafted [Dynasty Warriors-style] game I have ever seen\". They claimed that the game \"expands upon [Breath of the Wild] masterfully in both the iconic battle locations of the game and the soundtrack that accompanies them\".Giving the game a 4/5 rating, Scott Baird Screen Rant stated that the game \"offers a fascinating look into the world of Breath of the Wild alongside great gameplay\", praising the \"phenomenal combat system\" which \"rarely feels repetitive or dull\", the differences between the character playstyles, the \"hundreds of hours worth of content\", and the character development. However, he criticized the camera, which \"tends to get stuck during the indoor stages, which is especially frustrating when trying to dodge enemy attacks\". While Baird praised the game for offering \"a fascinating look at the world of Breath of the Wild\", he also pointed out that the setting \"severely limits the types of enemies that the players will encounter [compared to the first Hyrule Warriors], and the few additions to the lore (like elemental variations of monsters) feel less than impressive.\" Michael Goroff of Electronic Gaming Monthly also gave the game a 4 out of 5 review, praising the game's gameplay, and use of the universe, style, and gameplay elements from Breath of the Wild, calling it \"one of the most fun games I\u2019ve played all year\". However, he was critical of the story's choice to feature time travel. In his review, Daniel Dell-Cornejo of Nintendo Wire gave Age of Calamity an 8.5, praising the gameplay, art style, cutscenes, music, and large roster but expressed disappointment with the story direction and occasional drops in framerate.\n\nSales\nIn the United Kingdom, the game placed sixth in physical sales during its launch week, selling nearly 324% more copies than Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition during the same timeframe in 2018. It also sold 173,215 physical copies within its first week of release in Japan, making it the second best-selling retail game of the week in the country. It was ultimately the 16th highest selling game in Japan for 2020. In the United States the game was the sixth best-selling game during its launch month.Four days after its release, Koei Tecmo revealed that the game has shipped over 3 million digital and physical copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling Warriors game of all time and outselling all previous games in the entire Warriors franchise including all Dynasty Warriors games and their spin-offs, Fire Emblem Warriors, and the previous Hyrule Warriors games. The game has shipped over 3.5 million copies by the end of 2020. As of April 2021, the game has sold over 3.7 million units. As of January 2022, the game has sold 4 million units worldwide, making it one of the best-selling Switch games.\n\nLegacy\nStarting in January 2021, three characters from Age of Calamity cameo as collectable Spirits in the crossover fighting game Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. These characters are Impa, Master Kohga, and the Diminutive Guardian.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nHyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity at MobyGames\nHyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity at IMDb\nOfficial website",
    "Urbosa": "Urbosa is a fictional character from Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda series. She first appeared as one of the major characters in the 2017 action-adventure game The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild where she is the leader of the Gerudo and one of the four Champions who help Princess Zelda and Link to protect Hyrule from Calamity Ganon. She also appears in the 2020 hack-and-slash video game Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity as a playable character. Within the lore of the game series, Urbosa is the brave pilot of Divine Beast Vah Naboris, one of the four Divine Beasts that the Champions use to help Zelda protect Hyrule from Calamity Ganon. Like the other Champions, Urbosa has a unique skill that is used in gameplay, which is the ability to control the power of lightning. She has been positively received by both fans and critics due to her heroic, wise and charismatic character.\n\nConcept and creation\nGame Director Hidemaro Fujibayashi mentioned Urbosa as a favourite character in a behind-the-scenes featurette and stated that her name was the first to be finalised during the development of Breath of the Wild.\n\nCharacter design\nAs a member of the Gerudo race, Urbosa was designed with some common traits of her people. She has dark skin and red hair. She also has green eyes and blue lips. She wears a multicolored breastplate made of gold with two shoulder guards. Her gold belt supports her blue skirt, symbolizing that she is one of the Champions of Hyrule. She wears green high-heels and several gold jewels. Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity depicts Urbosa at a point in the storyline when she serves as Gerudo Chief before being named the Gerudo Champion. She wears the Chief's crown, which is identical to the one Riju wears as Chief in Breath of the Wild, and a black skirt with the Gerudo symbol on it. She keeps her signature weapon, the Scimitar of the Seven and her Daybreaker shield holstered to the back of her body. Urbosa has been noted for her tall stature and muscular build, which are common traits of the Gerudo.\n\nPortrayal\nIn both Breath of the Wild and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity Urbosa is voiced in English by Elizabeth Maxwell. She is voiced in Japanese by Rei Shimoda.\n\nCharacteristics\nUrbosa is the Chief of the Gerudo and a fierce leader. She is also the pilot of the Divine Beast of lightning, Vah Naboris. She has the ability to control the power of lightning. She wields her sword in battle, which shoots out green lightning, creating electrical storms to take down enemies. She can also snap her fingers to instantly destroy enemies with a bolt of lightning. Urbosa is depicted as a calm and confident authoritative figure, but also possesses great wit and a caring nature towards Zelda. She supports Zelda when she doubts her ability to unveil her power and does not hesitate to defend Link against Revali. In the backstory of Breath of the Wild, Urbosa is determined to come to the aid of Zelda in defence of Hyrule against Calamity Ganon, partly motivated by her personal resentment for Ganon's legacy (in his previous form as Ganondorf) as the only Gerudo male born in 100 years. As leader of the Gerudo, she is willing to risk her own life to protect her people by agreeing to pilot one of the Divine Beasts, despite her people pleading with her that it is too dangerous. In Link's sixth memory, shown in the form of a cutscene in Breath of the Wild, Urbosa displays great wisdom and inner strength, and also a special connection with Zelda, while watching over her as she sleeps. Urbosa is related to Riju, the current Gerudo Chief and her direct descendent who appears in the present-day storyline of Breath of the Wild.Like the other Champions, Urbosa has a unique skill that the player uses during gameplay. In Breath of the Wild, Urbosa bestows a skill upon Link named Urbosa's Fury, which is a powerful lightning attack. In Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, Urbosa can charge up her lightning to create a stronger attack on enemies.\n\nAppearances\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\nUrbosa appears in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild as one of its major characters. She is one of four Champions - including Mipha, Revali and Daruk - who are tasked with helping Princess Zelda and Link to protect Hyrule from Calamity Ganon. In the game's backstory, she commands one of the four Divine Beasts named Vah Naboris, an ancient technology, but Calamity Ganon manages to take control of the Divine Beasts, resulting in her death and the death of the other Champions with the exception of Link, who is put in a 100-year slumber. When Link awakens, he can go to Vah Naboris to try to tame it, and there he meets the spirit of Urbosa, who helps to guide him in the innards of the Divine Beast.Urbosa plays a major role in the backstory of Breath of the Wild, which is revealed to the player through cutscenes and Urbosa's diary entries. Urbosa is shown to have had a special connection with Zelda's mother, the Queen of Hyrule and this friendship is reflected in the support that she offers to Zelda. Urbosa displays maternal instincts towards Zelda, calling her by her nickname, \"Little bird\", which is a term of endearment. She also plays a motherly role in relation to other characters in the game, including Link and the other Champions. Urbosa is shown to be a strong supporter of the relationship between Link and Zelda and plays an active role in bringing them closer together. Her diary entries also reveal that she is willing to break the rules to help Link and Zelda's relationship by teaching Link how to enter Gerudo Town without getting thrown out for being male. Urbosa's supportive role continues after her death, specifically when her spirit appears in Breath of the Wild to encourage Link to destroy Calamity Ganon.\n\nHyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity\nUrbosa reappears as a playable character in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity. The game acts as a prequel with events being set 100 years before Breath of the Wild. The storyline takes place in an alternate timeline created when Terrako, a small Guardian that Zelda built in her childhood, time-travels into the past to prevent Hyrule's fate in the Breath of the Wild timeline. Urbosa arrives home to Gerudo Town just as Master Kohga, leader of the Yiga Clan, is about to strike down Zelda while disguised as Urbosa, only to be electrocuted into submission by Urbosa herself. Though Kohga later escapes thanks to his right-hand Sooga, Urbosa, due to her close friendship with Zelda, agrees to pilot Vah Naboris against the Calamity. After Zelda and Link gather the other Champions, they travel to Korok Forest to meet with the Great Deku Tree and recover the Master Sword, encountering Astor, the seer siding with the Yiga and Calamity Ganon. After recovering the Master Sword, Zelda voices her concern about Link changing after getting the Blade of Evil's Bane but Urbosa assures her that Link is still the same boy who served in the Hyrulean Army. Urbosa is then dubbed the Gerudo Champion and returns to pilot Vah Naboris to locate the Yiga Clan's hideout. Though Kohga and Sooga escape again, Urbosa returns to Gerudo Town to prepare for the Calamity's return as King Rhoam orders the civilians to evacuate and has the soldiers transferred to Hyrule's two main strongholds, Akkala Citadel and Fort Hateno, to reinforce the garrisons.\nWhen Calamity Ganon awakens, Urbosa is cut off from the other Champions and Hyrule Castle when Ganon shuts down the Sheikah Towers' teleportation ability, and soon finds herself fighting a stronger Thunderblight Ganon sent to take over Vah Naboris. Before she can be killed by the Blight Ganon like in the original timeline, she is saved by Riju and Patricia, summoned from the future by Terrako to protect Urbosa until Link arrives to aid them in destroying Thunderblight Ganon, keeping Vah Naboris under Urbosa's control. Joined by the other Champions and their Divine Beasts after they too were saved by the future Champions, they protect Akkala Citadel and Fort Hateno from the Calamity's forces, saving the Hyrulean Army in the process, and then defend the Great Plateau, where King Rhoam is revealed to have survived as well. After Purah summons Urbosa's Gerudo warrior women to bolster the Hyrulean Army with the Rito, Gorons, and Zoras, along with a reformed Master Kohga and the Yiga Clan, Zelda leads the full-scale assault to reclaim Hyrule Castle from the Calamity. Urbosa helps to defeat Astor and the Harbinger Ganon, that timeline's Terrako possessed by Malice from the future, before then facing Calamity Ganon. After the future Terrako sacrifices itself to weaken Calamity Ganon, Link delivers the finishing blow with the Master Sword, while Zelda uses her awakened power from the Triforce to seal away Calamity Ganon, winning the war in Hyrule's favor. Afterwards, Urbosa bids Riju and Patricia goodbye as, with their job done, they are returned to their own timeline with Yunobo, Sidon, and Teba, leaving Robbie and Purah to rebuild Terrako and reunite him with Zelda.\n\nOther media\nUrbosa appears in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as a Spirit.\n\nMerchandise\nFor the release of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Nintendo released Urbosa's Amiibo.\n\nReception\nUrbosa has received a generally positive reception. Holly Green of Paste Magazine considered her one of the best new characters of 2017, describing her as having the \"hip, disaffected charisma of a cowboy, with an aloof but affable charm\". Rich Meister of Destructoid also held her as one of his favorite characters of 2017, while fellow Destructoid contributor Pixie the Fairy called her a recent favorite. Pixie was \"awed\" by her when they played Breath of the Wild, citing how she is both \"heroic and fearsome\" and \"gentle, perceptive and wise.\" Hussain Almahr of Vice called her \"amazing,\" while feeling that Arabic themes in the Gerudo were not represented adequately in the game. Kent Springborn Jr. of The Collegian praised her voice actress as a standout among the cast of Breath of the Wild. Urbosa has been a popular choice for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, either as a group with the other Champions or on her own. Will Greenwald of Geek.com wanted her in despite his distaste for sword users in Super Smash Bros. He praised her as sexually attractive and praised her for being a \"warm, supportive leader\" and for helping raise Zelda and protecting Hyrule. Xavier Harding of Mic suggested that Urbosa would be a good choice to add further representation of Breath of the Wild to Super Smash Bros. He also discussed Urbosa as a person of color, praising her personality and calling her the Beyonc\u00e9 of the Gerudo race. Zelda's voice actress, Patricia Summersett, regarded Urbosa as her favorite Champion in the game, while Kyle Hilliard of Game Informer found her design to be the best of the Champions. In her review of Hyrule Warriors: Age Of Calamity for Kotaku, Ash Parrish singled out the option to play as Urbosa to be the singular highlight of the game for her.Screen Rant listed Urbosa in fifth place in a list of the 10 most powerful female characters in The Legend of Zelda, stating that she has been \"unanimously praised\" and a \"fan favourite\". Ryan Stevens of Cultured Vultures listed Urbosa in eighth place in a list of \"10 best giant women in video games\", remarking that she \"towers over Link, who is supposedly the hero of legend. She's also ruthlessly good at everything we see her do in flashbacks, making her a fan favorite character.\" Daniel Alexander for The Gamer listed Urbosa in second place on a list of \"the 10 best new characters in Breath of the Wild, commenting that, \"her strong will and maternal attachment to Zelda are apparent, making her one of the most interesting of the four Champions.\" Due to her popularity with fans, Urbosa has been the subject of many pieces of fan art and has also been recreated in cosplay form.\n\nSee also\nCharacters of The Legend of Zelda\n\n\n== References ==",

    "Princess Zelda": "Princess Zelda is the titular character in Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda video game series. She was created by Shigeru Miyamoto and introduced in the original 1986 game The Legend of Zelda. She is one of the central characters in the series, having appeared in multiple incarnations over more than three decades. In the fictional storyline of the series, she is a princess of the kingdom of Hyrule, an associate of the protagonist Link, and bearer of the Triforce of Wisdom.\nThough she is the eponymous character, Zelda's story role is often that of a damsel in distress or donor who assists Link. In many games, Zelda is captured by the antagonist Ganon, necessitating Link to come to her rescue. In several games she is one of the Sages or Champions whose heroism is essential to defeating Ganon; in others, like Ocarina of Time and The Wind Waker, she adopts alternative personas to take a more active role in the story. In Skyward Sword, she is established as the mortal reincarnation of the goddess Hylia, which gives her incarnations a range of magical powers.\nZelda is a widely recognisable character in video gaming and a popular character with gamers and cosplayers. In addition to The Legend of Zelda series, she has appeared as a playable character in a number of spin-off games and other game series, including Hyrule Warriors, Cadence of Hyrule and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity. She also appears as a playable character in the Super Smash Bros. series. Critics have responded positively to her character development and have listed her as one of the greatest female video game characters of all time.\n\nConcept and creation\nAccording to Shigeru Miyamoto, co-creator of The Legend of Zelda series, Princess Zelda's name was inspired by that of Zelda Fitzgerald, an American novelist, dancer, and socialite, as well as the wife of fellow novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald. In the Nintendo book titled Hyrule Historia, Miyamoto elaborated on the origin of the character's name and the title of the series. He stated that a PR planner had suggested creating an illustrated story for the game involving the rescue of a princess who was defined as an eternal beauty. He said to Miyamoto, 'There's a famous American author whose wife's name is Zelda. How about giving that name to the eternal beauty?' Miyamoto explained, \"I couldn't really get behind the book idea but I really liked the name Zelda. I asked him if I could use it, and he said that would be fine. And that's where the title The Legend of Zelda was born.\"The original 1986 video game The Legend of Zelda established Princess Zelda's core role in the series. It centres on the hero Link fighting to protect the kingdom of Hyrule from the antagonist Ganon, whilst saving Princess Zelda. This continued to be the basic premise for each subsequent game in the series, although Zelda's role has varied and evolved over time with each game release.\n\nCharacter incarnations\nAs with Link, there are multiple incarnations of Princess Zelda in the series, who vary in age, appearance, and disposition. Although these incarnations have similar appearances and bear the same name, they are not defined as the same person. Nintendo created a fictional timeline that spans thousands of years of fictional history and creates a continuity for all of the games in the series. The instruction booklet for Zelda II: The Adventure of Link establishes that Zelda's name reoccurs because the prince of the kingdom orders that, \"every female child born into the royal household shall be given the name Zelda\". The Nintendo book Hyrule Historia further emphasises that Zelda is a traditional name in the Hyrule royal family. Skyward Sword also creates an origin story for Zelda and Link's incarnations in which they are both cursed by the antagonist Demise to forever appear when evil occurs in Hyrule.\n\nCharacter design\nZelda's first appearance in the original The Legend of Zelda video game depicts her in a simple 2D form wearing a dress and small tiara. Illustrations created for the original game and displayed in the Nintendo book titled The Legend Of Zelda Art And Artifacts present a more detailed design for the character dressed in a long pink gown decorated with white bows and wearing a necklace and small tiara. Artwork for Zelda II: The Adventure of Link imitated Zelda's original appearance, presenting her wearing a similar long pink gown and red hair. For the development of A Link to the Past (1991), Zelda was originally designed wearing a sci-fi themed outfit to correspond with an early multi-world game concept, but this was eventually scrapped.The 1998 video game Ocarina of Time introduced a radical development for the character as a result of the improved graphical capabilities of the Nintendo 64. Princess Zelda was rendered in 3D for the first time and her detailed character model was accompanied by a more intricate backstory and involvement in the game. The princess was created in two forms, as a child and an adult. Her royal dress was designed with greater detail and displays a tabard featuring the Sheikah coat of arms and the Hyrule royal family crest. The storyline also involves the appearance of her alter-ego Sheik.Zelda appeared in cartoon form in the anime-inspired 2002 video game The Wind Waker. The art style was a vast departure from previous entries, both in terms of the cel-shaded graphics and also in the presentation of the character. Zelda appears as Tetra, a pirate captain whose disguise is vastly different to her traditional appearance as princess. Tetra's hair was designed as a swirl to mimic the wind and smoke in the game. This contrasts with her more traditional appearance as princess in the game wearing long hair and royal dress.In 2006, the release of Twilight Princess presented Zelda in a more realistic artistic style. The sombre tone of the game is also reflected in the dark portrayal of Zelda's character, which involves her being possessed by Ganondorf to become his puppet. Illustrator Yusuke Nakano tried to portray the princess as a pensive character, \"as if she's wondering about something\". He drew illustrations of Zelda with feelings of \"hopelessness and anxiousness\", but tried to avoid depicting her and Link \"too full of gloom and doom\".For Spirit Tracks (2009), Zelda was given a more active role in the gameplay, adventuring alongside Link in spirit form, which made a sharp contrast to her damsel in distress role in earlier installments. Eiji Aonuma, the series' longtime manager and producer, explained that this decision reflected the desires of fans and developers alike. A survey conducted in the United States signified consumers preferred more independent female characters, including Zelda's alter-egos Sheik (from Ocarina of Time) and Tetra (from The Wind Waker and Phantom Hourglass). Director, Daiki Iwamoto, also expressed an interest in making Zelda \"a more integral part of the game\" during the development of Spirit Tracks.In 2011, Zelda appeared in Skyward Sword as a student of the Knight Academy instead of her usual role as princess. The designers wanted her to look like a \"typical village girl\" and aimed to \"establish her as a heroine\". They removed the royal ornamentation from her head and designed her wearing sky blue and a red dress. They also created Zelda in her goddess form, in which she was designed, \"dressed simply, and in white\". Eiji Aonuma stated that his team had been \"looking at how we can create a Zelda that's not just a princess that needs to be rescued, but as somebody who has an active role and has her own part in the story.\"For the release of Breath of the Wild in 2017, a variety of concept art was considered for Zelda's character design. In a three-part series on the making of the game, Director Hidemaro Fujibayashi commented that Zelda's character was the most difficult to define. He explained, \"The planners started by thinking about what kind of person Zelda is, and why she's in a position that makes us want to save her... The designers, on the other hand, took a completely opposite approach, or perhaps I should say different approach compared to the planners. For them it was all about first impressions... about how Zelda's design could make you feel something deep inside.\" The team was so concerned about her design that they repeatedly made refinements to her design until the end of development. Alongside various dress designs, Zelda's image was updated to include outfits that showed her ready for combat, including the final blue blouse and pants that complemented Link's primary outfit.\n\nPortrayal\nPrincess Zelda has been voiced by several voice actors, including Bonnie Jean Wilbur in Link: The Faces of Evil and Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon, Brandy Kopp in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (World of Light only) and Stephanie Martone in Cadence of Hyrule. She is voiced by Canadian-American actress Patricia Summersett in Breath of the Wild. Summersett is the first English-language voice actress of Princess Zelda in the thirty years of the canonical video game series. Zelda has also been voiced by several Japanese actors, including Jun Mizusawa (Ocarina of Time, Twilight Princess, Super Smash Bros. Melee, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U), Hikari Tachibana (Four Swords Adventures, The Wind Waker, The Minish Cap, Hyrule Warriors), Akane Omae (Spirit Tracks), Ayumi Fujimura (A Link Between Worlds and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate), Saori Seto (Hyrule Warriors) and Y\u016b Shimamura (Skyward Sword, Breath of the Wild and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity).\n\nCharacteristics\nZelda is a princess and member of the royal family of Hyrule. She is typically depicted with blonde or brown hair and blue eyes and wears a royal dress, tiara and jewellery. Her appearance bears the characteristic traits of the Hylians, a fictional people that are human in form with elfin features, such as pointy ears. Throughout the series her age has ranged from a child to a teenager and young adult.In the early games, Zelda primarily takes the role of the damsel in distress for Link to save after she is kidnapped by the series main antagonist, Ganon. However, her role has evolved over the course of the series. She sometimes assists and guides Link during his adventures and aids him in battle. In Ocarina of Time, she appears dressed as a mysterious ninja named Sheik who helps Link on his journey. In The Wind Waker, she plays an active role in the game in the guise of Tetra and also takes part in the final battle to defeat Ganondorf. In Spirit Tracks she travels alongside Link in the form of a spirit and assists him in overcoming various obstacles. In Breath of the Wild, she plays a prominent role in the storyline, with a complete story arc that is revealed in the form of Link's memories and portrays her as an emotionally complex character.In the lore of the series, the first incarnation of Zelda is the mortal reincarnation of the goddess Hylia, a prominent deity within the games. Each subsequent incarnation of Zelda possesses the blood of the goddess and a range of inherent magical powers. Zelda also represents the physical embodiment of Hylia's struggle to protect the mortal world from evil and takes responsibility for protecting the kingdom of Hyrule.Zelda is also closely associated with Nayru, one of the three Golden Goddesses who are the creators of the fictional world of Hyrule. Like Link and Ganon, she is the bearer of one third of the Triforce, a mystical artefact and icon within the series. Zelda possesses the Triforce of Wisdom, which gives her the inherent qualities of intelligence and wisdom. In the original 1986 The Legend of Zelda, the Triforce of Wisdom is split into fragments, necessitating Link to retrieve it in order to defeat Ganon. In later games, it manifests itself within Zelda, giving her the ability to conjure light arrows.Throughout the series, Zelda has wielded various weapons. In Twilight Princess she is depicted holding a sword and also fights with a sword in Hyrule Warriors. She is also skilled in the use of a bow, which she uses to shoot light arrows at enemies, such as Ganondorf. In addition to using the Twilight Bow in Twilight Princess, Zelda's signature weapon is the Bow of Light, a recurring legendary weapon in the series. In Breath of the Wild, it is the most powerful bow in the game and she gifts it to Link to help him defeat Ganon in beast form. In Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, Zelda is able to unleash several powerful attacks using the Bow of Light, including creating rings of light around enemies to deal greater damage. She also uses the Sheikah Slate, a handheld tablet featuring several runes, to attack enemies remotely.Most iterations of Zelda have magical powers, such as teleportation, precognition, and the ability to heal. In A Link to the Past, she uses telepathy to communicate with Link after being captured. In Breath of the Wild, Zelda locks Ganon away in an alternate dimension using her sealing power, which is unlocked while defending Link during a fatal attack.\n\nRelationships\nWithin the lore of the Zelda series, Princess Zelda is directly connected to the other main characters, Link and Ganon. The three characters represent three parts of the Triforce, a mysterious artifact and prominent icon in many Zelda games that creates balance within the fictional universe. While Link embodies courage and Ganon represents power, Zelda's role is to be the embodiment of wisdom. The three characters are repeatedly connected in this struggle for the balance of power.Zelda's connection to Link has been a central aspect of The Legend of Zelda series, but their relationship has also been varied and ambiguous. Some games, such as Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, Ocarina of Time and Spirit Tracks have hinted at the possibility of a romantic relationship between the two characters. The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword placed greater emphasis on a romantic relationship in its storyline. To illustrate this, Nintendo released an official \"Romance Trailer\" for the game. However, producer Eiji Aonuma had originally planned to cut out any elements of romance from the game but decided to keep it in and explained, \"it wasn\u2019t that we wanted to create a romance between Link and Zelda as much as we wanted the player to feel like this is a person who\u2019s very important to me, who I need to find.\" In Breath of the Wild a more complex relationship between Link and Zelda is depicted in the storyline, which is revealed within various cutscenes of Link's memories. The memories provide a complete story arc for their relationship in which Zelda initially resents Link, but finally risks everything to protect him.\n\nAlter egos\nSheik\nIn The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Zelda disguises herself as a surviving member of the Sheikah clan under the name of Sheik (\u30b7\u30fc\u30af, Sh\u012bku). With voice muffled and face concealed, as well as wearing a form-fitting blue unitard with the red Sheikah eye in the center, Sheik is unrecognizable as Zelda. Sheik plays the lyre and teaches Link new songs to help him on his quest. When Link arrives at the Temple of Time near the end of the game, she uses the Triforce of Wisdom and reverts to Zelda. Zelda reveals that she disguised herself as Sheik to hide from Ganondorf, who wants to take the Triforce of Wisdom from her so that he can possess all three pieces of the Triforce and control its power. When she reveals her real identity to Link, she magically transforms into her traditional form wearing her princess attire. This reveal is foreshadowed by a Gossip Stone located outside Hyrule Castle that states, \"contrary to her elegant image, Princess Zelda of Hyrule Castle is, in fact, a tomboy\". Sheik's gender was the subject of debate, with some fans believing that Zelda transforms herself into a male character in Ocarina of Time. However, Nintendo senior product marketing manager Bill Trinen responded by stating, \"The definitive answer is that Sheik is a woman \u2014 simply Zelda in a different outfit.\" In 2016, Miyamoto revealed in an interview that the development team had considered the possibility of producing a spin-off game with Sheik as the protagonist. Sheik was also released as one of several compatible amiibo with The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.\n\nTetra\nTetra (\u30c6\u30c8\u30e9, Tetora) is a young pirate captain who is the incarnation of Zelda in The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and its Nintendo DS sequel, The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass. Like Sheik, she plays a major role in the storyline, by helping Link to find his sister, Aryll. However, rather than purposefully taking on the guise of Tetra, Zelda is unaware of her royal bloodline until the end of the game. Tetra is an orphan who inherits her position as pirate captain from her mother, who died when she was young. Throughout The Wind Waker, she is depicted as a strong but compassionate leader and like Sheik appears at various points in the storyline to help Link. When Ganondorf realises that Tetra is really Zelda, she only believes it is her true identity when it is revealed by the Triforce of Wisdom. Tetra's transformation into Zelda takes place when the long lost king of Hyrule attaches a small golden object to Tetra's necklace to form the Triforce of Wisdom. This surrounds Tetra with blinding white light that subsides and reveals Zelda in her true princess form. After this reveal, she spends the remaining part of the game in her traditional appearance of Zelda, but reappears as Tetra at the end of the game.The Phantom Hourglass follows on from The Wind Waker with Link and Tetra exploring the sea. Tetra is captured on a ghost ship, and Link must defeat the monster Bellum to save her. In a 2011 interview with GamesRadar+, Eiji Aonuma commented on the possibility of Tetra reappearing within the Zelda series by saying, \"Personally, I really like the character, but the director on the DS games after that, Mr. Iwamoto, said he didn't really like her, so he didn't want to use her.\"\n\nAppearances\nThe Legend of Zelda series\nAs the eponymous character of the series, Princess Zelda has appeared in most of The Legend of Zelda games. However, there have been several games in which she does not make an appearance, including Link's Awakening (1993), Majora's Mask (2000), where she only appears in a flashback, and Tri Force Heroes (2015).In Zelda's first appearance in the original The Legend of Zelda (1986), she is kidnapped by Ganon, the series' main antagonist, who seeks to steal the Triforce of Wisdom from her. However, before he is able to capture her, she divides the Triforce of Wisdom into eight pieces and hides the pieces across the land. She is eventually rescued by Link, and the two of them reunite the Triforces of Wisdom and Power. Although Zelda has only a minor role in the game, she was established as a central character in the storyline.Zelda reappears in the sequel, Zelda II: The Adventure of Link (1987). According to the game's manual, this incarnation of Zelda has been put into an eternal slumber after refusing to give up the power of the Triforce. Link breaks the curse by retrieving the Triforce and using its power to awaken her. This is the first game showing a relationship between the two characters, as Zelda rewards Link with a kiss at the end of the game.In A Link to the Past (1991), Zelda is given a prominent role in the storyline and is established as a major character in the battle between good and evil. She is described as one of seven maidens descended from seven sages who sealed away Ganon during the Imprisoning War, a battle fought against Ganon's evil army. She is kidnapped and telepathically pleads with Link to rescue her. After being rescued, she and the six other maidens assist Link in breaking the seal on Ganon's tower so that Link may defeat the villain.In Ocarina of Time (1998), Zelda first appears as a child. Suspicious of the Gerudo King Ganondorf, she charges Link with the task of collecting the three spiritual stones to open the door to the Sacred Realm and obtain the Master Sword and Triforce before Ganondorf does. Just before Link pulls the Master Sword from its pedestal, Ganondorf reveals his wicked intentions and Zelda flees Hyrule Castle with her guardian Impa before he can capture either of them. Still in hiding seven years later, she poses as a young Sheikah boy named Sheik. When Link wakes up after seven years, she guides him on his quest to save Hyrule's Sages before revealing her true identity. With Zelda's help, Link defeats Ganondorf after he transforms into his beast form named Ganon.In Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages (2001), Zelda only appears after inputting a secret code that is obtained upon completing one of the games. In the storyline, she senses danger in the lands of Holodrum and Labrynna and sends her handmaiden Impa to protect Din, the Oracle of Seasons, and Nayru, the Oracle of Ages. In the full linked game, Zelda is captured by Twinrova and it is revealed that they plan to sacrifice her in order to ignite the Flame of Despair and resurrect Ganon once again, however Link intervenes and takes on Ganon in the final boss battle.Four Swords (2002) presents Princess Zelda as one of many descendants who protect the seal on the Four Sword. In the plot, she takes Link to the Four Sword Sanctuary, which seals the evil sorcerer Vaati. Sensing that the seal's power is diminishing, she tries to inspect it, but is captured by Vaati, who had already escaped and takes her to his Palace of Winds to marry her. She is again rescued by Link with the power of the Four Sword and together they seal Vaati away.The Zelda character in The Wind Waker (2002) is unaware of her royal identity, living instead as the pirate captain named Tetra. She first appears in the clutches of a giant bird called the Helmaroc King, though she struggles and is dropped at the top of Link's home island of Outset. She then agrees to help Link rescue his younger sister Aryll, whom the Helmaroc King has subsequently captured. She decides to help Link confront Ganon at the Forbidden Fortress, but they are unsuccessful in defeating him. Ganondorf discovers Tetra's true identity as Princess Zelda when the Triforce of Wisdom is repaired. In the final boss battle against Ganondorf, she assists Link by using his bow to shoot arrows of light.In Four Swords Adventures (2004), the storyline is set in motion when dark clouds cause Zelda to fear the return of Vaati. While attempting to reseal him, she and the six maidens are captured by Dark Link. To save them, Link uses the Four Sword but accidentally sets Vaati free. After Link rescues her, it is revealed that Ganon is behind the capture. After Vaati is defeated, Zelda helps Link to finally defeat Ganon by giving him the Magic Bow.In The Minish Cap (2004), Princess Zelda is turned to stone by Vaati, who shatters the legendary Picori Blade and breaks the seal that prevents evil spreading across Hyrule. Link is tasked with saving the princess by restoring the Picori Blade in order to lift the curse.Twilight Princess (2006) centres around the Twilight King Zant invading the kingdom of Hyrule. Zelda is forced to surrender to Zant in order to protect her people. This results in the kingdom being enveloped in Twilight and the people of Hyrule disappearing and becoming spirits. The game involves Link, who is transformed into a wolf by the Twilight Realm's power, and his companion Midna working together to free Hyrule from the Twilight before finally defeating Zant, who is revealed to be a devotee of Ganondorf. Towards the end of the game, Zelda appears as the ninth boss when she is possessed by Ganondorf and controlled like a puppet. In the final battle with Ganondorf, Zelda accompanies Link on horseback and offers support by stunning Ganondorf with Light Arrows.Phantom Hourglass (2007) follows on from the storyline of The Wind Waker and reintroduces Zelda in her Tetra incarnation. When Tetra is turned to stone and kidnapped by a Ghost Ship, Link jumps overboard and is rescued by a fairy named Ciela. In order to save Tetra, he must set sail with Ciela and a sea captain named Linebeck to find the guardians of Power, Wisdom, and Courage.In Spirit Tracks (2009) Zelda meets Link, who is a railroad engineer, at his graduation ceremony. She is attacked by villainous Chancellor Cole and her spirit is separated from her body. In this ghostly form, she agrees to accompany Link on his adventure. Spirit Tracks differs from other Zelda games by featuring Zelda as a playable cooperative character. In her spirit form, she is able to possess Phantom Knights in order to help Link restore the Spirit Tracks. Her character can perform various tasks to help Link, such as carrying him on her shield or distracting enemy Phantoms so that Link can sneak past.Though not a princess in Skyward Sword (2011), Zelda is presented as the reincarnation of the goddess Hylia and the character's first incarnation within the fictional timeline. Zelda is a close childhood friend to Link who grew up with him in Skyloft, a place in the clouds. When she is spirited away in a tornado conjured by the demon lord Ghirahim, Link travels to the Surface to search for Zelda. He is eventually reunited with Zelda after opening the Gate of Time. Ghirahim drags Zelda to the past and uses her power to release the antagonist Demise in the past to change events. After Link defeats Demise in battle, he and Zelda remain on the Surface to establish Hyrule Kingdom.In A Link Between Worlds (2013), Zelda entrusts the Pendant of Courage to Link when the sorcerer Yuga begins capturing the descendants of the Seven Sages. After obtaining the remaining two pendants and drawing the Master Sword, Link pursues Yuga but is made to watch when he turns Zelda into a painting and casts her into the dying world of Lorule. Pursuing them to Lorule, Link is nearly destroyed by Yuga when he uses the Sages to revive Ganon and steal his Triforce of Power, but he is saved when Zelda's Lorule counterpart Princess Hilda binds Yuga. On Hilda's suggestion, Link rescues the Sages and is given the Triforce of Courage, then returns to Hilda only to see her taking Zelda's Triforce of Wisdom. She reveals that everything that had happened in Hyrule was intentionally designed to gather the Triforce so that Hilda can steal it and use its magic to restore Lorule. Hilda orders Yuga to take Link's Triforce of Courage, but Yuga betrays Hilda and turns her into a painting alongside Zelda. After Yuga's death, Zelda and Hilda are returned to normal, but Hilda refuses to accept defeat until Link's own Lorule counterpart Ravio convinces her that she has no right to rob Hyrule of its Triforce. Taking pity on Hilda, Zelda and Link use their Triforce to restore Lorule's own, allowing Hilda's kingdom to flourish once again.In the backstory of Breath of the Wild (2017), Zelda is at the forefront of the storyline, which is revealed through a series of cutscenes showing Link's memories. The cutscenes depict her struggles to awaken her sacred power and show her insecurities and initial resentment towards Link after he is appointed as her personal knight. Calamity Ganon appears and takes control of the Guardians and Divine Beasts, ancient Sheikah machinery used to defeat him ten millennia previously. Zelda finally awakens her sacred power while protecting Link from a fatal blow and sends him to be placed in stasis in the Shrine of Resurrection. She uses her power to seal Calamity Ganon and herself in Hyrule Castle. After 100 years she awakens Link so that he can finally destroy Ganon. In the final battle, she gives Link the Bow of Light to defeat Ganon in his dark beast form.In 2023, Zelda and Link are due to reappear in the as yet untitled Breath of the Wild sequel. The upcoming release is set within the same game world and features the characters with similar appearances to their 2017 versions. Nintendo released a trailer for the game in its E3 2021 Nintendo Direct, which showed various scenes from the game, including a clip of Zelda falling into an abyss.\n\nSpin-off games\nZelda appears in three CD-i games based on The Legend of Zelda series. In Link: The Faces of Evil (1993), she is kidnapped by Ganon and has to be rescued by Link. In Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon (1993) and Zelda's Adventure (1994), Princess Zelda is the protagonist and must save Link. Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon is noteworthy as the first time that Zelda appeared as a playable character. However, the series is generally criticized by fans and not recognized by Nintendo as canon.Zelda is a playable character in Hyrule Warriors (2014). Her weapons include the light arrows, which have been associated with her in several previous Zelda games, a rapier, as well as the Wind Waker, the titular conductor's baton from the series' entry. The Dominion Rod from Twilight Princess is also available as downloadable content for the Wii U game and in Hyrule Warriors Legends (2016) for the Nintendo 3DS. In addition to her Hyrule Warriors incarnation, Tetra and Toon Zelda (her incarnation from Spirit Tracks) appear in Hyrule Warriors Legends (and can be added to Hyrule Warriors as downloadable content). Tetra fights primarily wielding a Cutlass and water magic-infused pistol, though like Princess Zelda can use Light Arrows during certain attacks. Toon Zelda uses her ghostly form to possess a Phantom and fights wielding its sword and shield known as Phantom Arms. In addition to her Phantom, Toon Zelda can also leave it briefly during certain attacks to unleash the power of her spirit. Tetra can be unlocked through the latter part of the main story of Hyrule Warriors Legends, while Toon Zelda appears as part of the \"Phantom Hourglass & Spirit Tracks\" downloadable content.Zelda is a playable character in the rhythm game Cadence of Hyrule, which was released in 2019 for the Nintendo Switch. It is a crossover between Crypt of the NecroDancer and The Legend of Zelda series.In Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity (2020), a prequel to Breath of the Wild, Princess Zelda is one of eighteen playable characters. The game tells the story of the Great Calamity that happened 100 years before Breath of the Wild.\n\nOther game series\nZelda was introduced in the Super Smash Bros. series as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Melee (2001) and has appeared in every subsequent game, including Super Smash Bros. Brawl (2008), Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U (2014) and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (2018). Her character moves mainly involve magical attacks. In Super Smash Bros. Brawl her design was based on her appearance in Twilight Princess. In a 2007 interview, Eiji Aonuma said that his design team had submitted initial character models for Sheik, Link and Ganondorf for use within the Brawl environment and Sheik was confirmed as a returning character. An alternate color variation for Zelda with an appearance similar to that of Super Smash Bros. Melee was also included in Brawl. The Twilight Princess incarnation of Zelda and Sheik returned in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, this time as separate characters with no ability to switch between them in mid-battle. In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Sheik's design took inspiration from the Sheikah Set in Breath of the Wild and Zelda's design is based on her appearance in A Link Between Worlds and A Link To The Past.\n\nTelevision series\nA set of The Legend of Zelda cartoons aired from 1989 to 1990 as a part of DiC's The Super Mario Bros. Super Show. The series was loosely based on the original game and centres on four main characters, Link, Zelda, Ganon and a fairy named Spryte. It also features Zelda's father, King Harkinian. The series developed Zelda's character and presents her with a strong personality. Although she is sometimes captured by Ganon, she is depicted as a smart, resourceful character. The series also emphasises a romantic relationship between Link and Zelda, in which Link is always begging Zelda for a kiss. Thirteen episodes were produced before the cancellation of The Super Mario Bros. Super Show. Zelda was voiced by Cyndy Preston in the TV series.A version of cartoon Zelda (with slightly more revealing clothing) appeared in assorted episodes in the second season of Captain N: The Game Master. In this crossover, Zelda and Link befriend Kevin Keene and Princess Lana as they all attempt to restore peace to Hyrule. These appearances function as a follow-up to the original Zelda cartoon.\n\nComics and manga\nA comic series published in the early 1990s by Valiant Comics was based on the adventures of Zelda and Link. It ran for five issues, with a sixth story published under the Nintendo Comics System brand. The storyline echoes The Legend of Zelda animated television series, which was being aired around the same time. Like the animated series, it involves Link attempting to get a kiss from Zelda, but also depicts Zelda displaying affections towards Link. In the storyline for \"To the First Power\", Zelda trains to defend herself and eventually defeats a wizzrobe in order to save Link.A serial comic by manga author Shotaro Ishinomori was originally published in 1992 in Nintendo Power magazine and later collected in graphic novel form. It was based on The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and tells an alternate version of the events. It was reprinted as a single volume in 2015 by Viz Media. Other manga adaptations of The Legend of Zelda games have also been published, including Majora's Mask, Ocarina of Time, The Minish Cap and Phantom Hourglass, which are illustrated by Akira Himekawa.\n\nGamebooks\nAlongside Link, Zelda appears in several Nintendo gamebooks. Two books titled The Crystal Trap and The Shadow Prince were published in 1992, which were written in the style of Choose Your Own Adventure books. In The Crystal Trap, the plot focuses on Zelda freeing Link from the trap, while The Shadow Prince involves Link saving Zelda.\n\nReception\nCritical reception\nPrincess Zelda has been generally well received by critics and gamers alike. Chip ranked Princess Zelda as the third top \"girl of gaming\" in general. Complex placed Zelda and Sheik in the fourth and third places on its 2012 list of video game characters that deserve a spin-off. Entertainment Weekly's Darren Franich listed her as one of 15 \"kick-ass women\" in video games in 2013, praising how her portrayal developed from the mere princess who \"got kidnapped, over and over again\" in early games to \"a wise-beyond-her-years youth into a major player in the battle for Hyrule\" in Ocarina of Time. Den of Geek ranked Zelda in fourth place on a list of \"10 Best Female Game Characters\" in 2013. Zelda's alter-ego Tetra was recognised by The Guardian as one of 30 \"interesting female game characters\", with the comment, \"despite her young age, Tetra demands respect and gets it.\"Critics and gamers have also commented on Zelda's physical attractiveness. GameDaily listed her as one of the 50 \"hottest video game women\" in 2009, stating that while she did not start out as much, she became beautiful in later games. In 2010, Wesley Yin-Poole of VideoGamer.com included her on his list of \"top ten video game crushes\", stating: \"We love Peach and Kitana, but if we were stranded on a desert island and could only keep one video game princess for company, it would be Princess Zelda from the Legend of Zelda series - we've had the hots for Zelda's pointy ears for years, ever since her 8-bit days, in fact.\" That same year, GameTrailers included her on their countdown of the \"Top 10 babes who are out of your league\" at number four. Game Informer listed Sheik second on its 2011 list of the top ten disguises. In 2014, Julia Cook of Paste ranked Princess Zelda from Four Swords as the third \"best dressed lady\" in video games. TF1 ranked her in 13th place on its 2010 list of the sexiest video game characters to cosplay.The relationship between Link and Princess Zelda has also been positively received. It was ranked as the number one video game romance by James Hawkins of Joystick Division, who commented, \"Never overtly called-out and not yet actualized, this tacit romance has shaped one of gaming's greatest franchises.\" IGN chose Link and Zelda as one of \"The Greatest Video Game Couples\", particularly highlighting their story in Skyward Sword.\n\nCritical commentary\nSome critical commentary has focused on Zelda's role within the series. The book Female Action Heroes described Zelda as \"perhaps one of the most well-known princesses in video game history\", though acknowledged that her role in the games was to serve as a \"damsel in distress\".SVG.com's Cody Gravelle commented that, \"Princess Zelda is so famous she has an entire video game series named after her despite not having starred as the protagonist in any of its entries\" and stated that despite being his best ally, she is \"often overshadowed by Legend of Zelda protagonist and sometimes-partner Link.\"Brendan Main for The Escapist magazine noted that Zelda's alter-ego of Sheik in Ocarina of Time broke the conventions of the character's role. He opined, \"Sheik is everything Zelda is not \u2013 in fact, she's everything that Zelda cannot be. As far as princesses go, Zelda gets off better than most. She brings a certain stately grace to the role, and is a figure of wisdom and insight. Operating in a trinity that includes the villain, Ganon, symbolic of power, and the hero, Link, symbolic of courage, Zelda serves as seer and spiritual conduit. But though she is elegant and refined, it is exactly these traits that keep her off of the field of play. As an oracle, she may offer advice and comfort, but she\u2019s still a captive to forces beyond her control.\"Ashley Taylor Clark for Looper responded positively to Zelda's appearance in Breath of the Wild, describing her as, \"an intelligent, passionate young woman\" and commenting, \"Her burgeoning friendship with Link shows a vulnerability that fans don't often see in a line of level-headed princesses. Instead, this Zelda struggles to fulfill her destiny and worries that her failure will mean destruction for the people she cherishes. Fully-voiced cutscenes also bring her character to life in a more relatable and human way than ever before\".Jason Guisao writing for Game Informer noted that even though the entire series is named after the character, she had been sidelined in Breath of the Wild, and stated, \"Zelda\u2019s time to shine is long overdue\". He opined, \"Zelda should be leading the charge towards a new era where long-awaited features like fully integrated co-op \u2013 e.g., the two protagonists embarking on a harrowing, 100-hour quest together \u2013 could exist.\" Jacob Kastrenakes for The Verge opined that switching Link's and Zelda's roles could be possible without requiring Link to be absent. However, in an interview with GameSpot, Producer Eiji Aonuma confirmed that this idea had been considered but rejected for Breath of the Wild because, \"if we have Princess Zelda as the main character who fights, then what is Link going to do?\" Miyamoto also commented on this at E3 2016, stating, \"Some people might wonder, you know, because the title is Zelda \u2013 it's a female character \u2013 why isn't the protagonist a female character? But really, to me, The Legend of Zelda, the main series, Link is the protagonist.\"Sara Gitkos of iMore opined, \"we think it's about time that Zelda had a chance to show why she deserves a game of her own\" and commented, \"Zelda is a scholar, a leader, and a fierce princess who takes charge of her own destiny. She is clearly a character that has a lot to offer, and it might bring a fresh look to the series to give her a shot as the main protagonist. She has proven that she can handle the likes of Ganon, and if Link can have a solo adventure without her, why can't she?\"\n\nLegacy\nDue to her popularity with gamers, Zelda's image has been recreated in various works of fan art. She has also been recreated in the form of cosplay. As the titular character, her image is widely used across various merchandise, including promotional artwork, figurines and Amiibo. Actor and comedian Robin Williams named his daughter Zelda Williams after Princess Zelda, due to being a fan of The Legend of Zelda series.Critics and gamers consider Zelda to be a significant video game character in popular culture. In 2009, she was voted the third greatest female character in games on Nintendo systems by the Official Nintendo Magazine, which appreciated her as \"a strong woman who, with her sword and bow and arrow, is capable of holding her own in a fight.\" Complex ranked her as the fifth greatest heroine in video game history in 2013 and ranked her at number five on its 2013 list of \"old school\" video game characters \"who were style icons\". In 2016, Digital Spy ranked the character in sixth place on a list of the \"Most iconic female game characters of all time\". In 2018, readers of Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition voted Princess Zelda as the 31st-top video game character of all time.\n\nSee also\nCharacters of The Legend of Zelda\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Princess Zelda at Wikimedia Commons\n\nPrincess Zelda page at Play Nintendo",
    "Mipha": "Mipha is a fictional character in Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda series. She was introduced as a major character in the 2017 action-adventure game The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. She also appears as a playable character in the 2020 hack-and-slash video game Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity. Mipha is a princess of the Zora and one of the four Champions, including Urbosa, Revali and Daruk, who aid Princess Zelda and Link to fight against the threat of Calamity Ganon. Mipha pilots Divine Beast Vah Ruta, one of the four Divine Beasts that the Champions use to fight against Calamity Ganon. Mipha also has a unique set of skills related to the aquatic Zora, including the power to manipulate water in battle and the power to heal. Within the storyline of Breath of the Wild she displays romantic affections for the hero, Link. Since her introduction, Mipha has received a positive reception from critics for her tragic and complex character.\n\nConcept and creation\nCharacter design\nLead artist Hirohito Shinoda stated in development notes that he used a dolphin as the basis for Mipha's design. Cinematic designer Naoki Mori said that Mipha's relationship with Link was intended to be different to his relationship with Princess Zelda and commented that, \"it almost ended up being too intense. I tried to balance things by making her into a quieter person.\"As a member of the Zora, Mipha is a humanoid character with design features that resemble a fish. She bears a tail fin on her head and other typical features of the amphibious Zora, that help her to live and swim in the waters of Zora's Domain with ease. She is quite short in stature when compared with other Hyrulean characters and smaller than the average Zora girl. When in combat, Mipha is depicted carrying her Lightscale Trident. In a Breath of the Wild behind-the-scenes interview, developer Aonuma-san commented that he is a fan of Mipha.\n\nPortrayal\nIn both Breath of the Wild and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, the English voice actor for Mipha is Amelia Gotham. She is voiced by Mayu Isshiki in Japanese. Gotham auditioned for the part of Zelda, but was cast as the voice of Mipha instead.\n\nCharacteristics\nMipha is a Zora princess, being the daughter of King Dorephan, the ruler of Zora's Domain. She is also the pilot of the Divine Beast of water, Vah Ruta. Mipha has a deep bond with her younger brother, Prince Sidon who appears as a character in Breath of the Wild. As a member of Zora royalty, she is beloved by her people due to her kind, gentle and sensitive nature and the storyline makes it evident that the Zora miss her after her death. Mipha has a meek demeanour, but she is a skilled athlete and is renowned amongst the Zora for her abilities to use a spear and to effortlessly glide up and down waterfalls in Zora's Domain. She also has a powerful ability to heal. In Breath of the Wild, she bestows a unique healing skill upon Link named Mipha's Grace. In Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, she is the only character who can heal herself. Mipha displays emotional and logical intelligence, which is evidenced by her ability to communicate with the other Champions as a team. In the backstory, she is educated by the Zora historian Jiahto, which gives her the knowledge required to rule a kingdom. As a child, Mipha is mentored by the Zora Royal Advisor, Muzu who cares for her like his own daughter, however, despite their close connection, Mipha chooses to keep her love for Link a secret from him and also her intention to propose to Link. Despite her meekness, Mipha is incredibly brave, choosing to help Link to defeat a Lynel even before she is chosen as Champion. She is also incredibly perceptive and makes notes of her personal observations in her journal, many of which are about Link.\n\nAppearances\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\nMipha is introduced as one of the four Champions that Princess Zelda recruits to protect Hyrule against Calamity Ganon in the backstory of Breath of the Wild. Like the other Champions, she is the pilot of one of the four Divine Beasts. She pilots the Divine Beast of water, named Vah Ruta and is the first of the Champions to master her Divine Beast. Mipha, alongside the other three Champions, loses her life during the battle with Calamity Ganon. During the game, the backstory reveals that Mipha and Link were once childhood friends. In a cutscene that is one of Link's memories named \"Mipha's Touch\", Mipha reminisces with Link about their past and promises to always heal him. Mipha is shown to have romantic feelings for Link to such an extent that she makes Zora armour for him to wear. However, the storyline does not reveal whether Link returns her affections. She reappears in the present-day storyline as a spirit when Link wakes up 100 years later. When Link takes control of Divine Beast Vah Ruta, Mipha's spirit is set free, but despite her love for Link, she understands that she can never be with him. After Link defeats Waterblight Ganon and gains control of Vah Ruta, Mipha fulfils her promise to Link by bestowing a powerful healing skill named Mipha's Grace upon him. She apologises to her father for not returning safely and wishes that she could see her family again. Link honours her memory by wearing the Zora armour that she made for him and by aiding the Zora people.\n\nHyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity\nIn Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, Mipha returns as a playable character. She wields the Lightscale Trident or Zora Spear in battle and has the ability to heal herself and her allies on the battlefield. She also uses her skill to manipulate water to create water-based attacks. The game acts as a prequel to Breath of the Wild, with the storyline recounting the Champions' first failed attempt to defeat Calamity Ganon 100 years earlier. The storyline begins with Zelda's small Guardian Terrako travelling through a portal into the past to warn Zelda about the future. Zelda then goes on a quest to recruit a roster of characters to help protect Hyrule. Mipha plays a major role in the storyline as she is one of the four Champions recruited to pilot one of the Divine Beasts. During a cutscene, Mipha bravely accepts her role as the Zora Champion, although her father King Dorephan says that it is only on the condition that she returns safely. In contrast to her story arc in Breath of the Wild, Mipha's love for Link is less significant in the storyline of Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity. The devastating impact of Mipha's death on her brother Sidon is shown to be still evident, as he sometimes displays signs of heartache when her death is mentioned during gameplay.\n\nOther media\nMipha also makes an appearance in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as a Spirit.\n\nMerchandise\nFor Breath of the Wild, Nintendo released an amiibo of Mipha, which was reprinted for the launch of Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity.\n\nReception\nMipha has received a positive reception from fans and critics. Madeline Carpou for Screen Rant opined that Mipha is a \"fascinating, complex character\" and \"a beloved character in the Zelda franchise and one of the most memorable figures in Breath Of The Wild.\" Carpou also opined that Mipha is \"one of the most tragic characters in the game\", because \"she never got the chance to tell Link just how much she loved him.\" Jessica Filby for Screen Rant listed Mipha in seventh place on a list of Breath Of The Wild characters based on likability, in which she commented that Mipha, \"plays a huge part in the storyline and Links adventure, which only works to strengthen and improve the love many players have for her. She is the perfect representation of excellence and power, something the people of Hyrule and her brother definitely recognize and respect.\" The Outerhaven included Mipha in a list of \"Favourite Legend of Zelda Characters\" because \"she had the backstory you cried over\". Daniel Alexander for The Gamer ranked Mipha in third place on a list of \"The 10 Best New Characters In Breath Of The Wild\" noting her \"nurturing personality and love for Link\". Mipha was also listed by The Gamer in second place in a list of \"The 10 Strongest Women in the Zelda Series\", noting her fighting skills with a spear, her healing ability and her relationship with Link. Callum Archer for The Gamer remarked on Mipha's skills in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, by saying that she is \"one of the strongest characters in the game in almost every regard\". Game Rant described Mipha as \"a beloved character\" and \"an inspirational member of the Zora royal family that serves a crucial role over Link's journey in Breath of the Wild.\" Due to Mipha's popularity as a character, she has been the subject of numerous works of fan art, cosplay, tweets and memes that have centered around her physically attractive qualities.\n\nSee also\nCharacters of The Legend of Zelda\n\nNotes\n\n\n== References ==",
    "Link (The Legend of Zelda)": "Link is a fictional character and the protagonist of Nintendo's video game series The Legend of Zelda. He is one of Nintendo's most iconic characters. He was created by Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. Link was introduced as the hero of the original 1986 The Legend of Zelda video game and has appeared in a total of 19 entries in the series, as well as a number of spin-offs. Common elements in the series include Link travelling through Hyrule whilst exploring dungeons, battling creatures and solving puzzles until he eventually defeats the series' primary antagonist, Ganon, and saves Princess Zelda.\nThroughout The Legend of Zelda series, Link has made multiple appearances in a variety of incarnations. He has been rendered in both 2D and 3D form and has been traditionally depicted in his signature green cap and tunic carrying a sword and shield. Over the course of the series, he appears as a child or young adult of the Hylian race, which originates from the fictional kingdom of Hyrule. Within Zelda lore, Link is the soul of a legendary hero that throughout history is reincarnated within a seemingly ordinary boy or man when the need arises for a new warrior to defeat the forces of evil. To defeat Ganon, Link usually obtains the mystical Master Sword or a similar legendary weapon, which is obtained after completing various trials. Over the course of his journey, he also acquires other magical items, including musical instruments and other weaponry.\nIn addition to the main series, Link has appeared in other Nintendo media, including merchandise, comics and manga, and an animated television series. He is a prominent character in various spin-off games, including Hyrule Warriors, Cadence of Hyrule and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity. He has appeared in entries of several other game franchises, including the Super Smash Bros. series, SoulCalibur II and Mario Kart 8, and has also been referenced in other games, such as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.\nAlongside fellow Nintendo character Mario, Link is one of the most recognisable characters in the video game industry, with critics considering him to be a significant game character in popular culture. He has been positively received by critics and fans and is a popular character within the video game community. According to Guinness World Records, Link is the most critically acclaimed videogame playable character and the most ubiquitous action-adventure video game character, surpassing Mario. He has been recognised by the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition as the second best video game character of all time after Mario. Critics have also named him as one of the most influential video game characters of all time and one of Shigeru Miyamoto's most famous creations.\n\nConcept and creation\nLink's creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, said that his concepts of The Legend of Zelda and Link were based on his childhood memories as well as books and movies he and video game designer Takashi Tezuka had enjoyed, notably J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. Miyamoto tried to make people identify with Link and have the opportunity to be heroes like the character. Although at the end of some games, Link becomes vastly talented in physical skill and magical prowess, he usually starts off the game as a regular boy.Link's sprite design was created by designer Takashi Tezuka. Shigeru Miyamoto stated in an interview with Gamekult that Takashi Tezuka used the Disney character Peter Pan as a source of inspiration when creating Link in order to make the character recognisable. Due to the limited capabilities of the technology at the time, Nintendo was only able to use three colours and the development team decided to choose green as Link's signature colour, as the game was mainly set within a forest environment. Link's sword and shield, long hat and ears were all created to make the character easily distinguishable.On the origin of the name \"Link\", Miyamoto said, \"Link's name comes from the fact that originally, the fragments of the Triforce were supposed to be electronic chips. The game was to be set in both the past and the future and as the main character would travel between both and be the link between them, they called him Link.\" However, he has also stated in the Nintendo book titled Hyrule Historia that the character is named Link because he, \"connects people together\" and that, \"he was supposed to spread the scattered energy of the world through the ages.\"\n\nCharacter incarnations\nThere have been several iterations of Link within The Legend of Zelda series. Each incarnation of Link bears a similar appearance and role as the hero within the various Zelda games, with nearly every game resetting the storyline. According to The Legend of Zelda Encyclopedia, Link is \"not just one individual; he is the hero reborn to many homes, over the course of many lifetimes, chosen by the goddesses with a single purpose: to stand up and fight when evil descends upon Hyrule.\" Miyamoto stated, \"For every Zelda game we tell a new story, but we actually have an enormous document that explains how the game relates to the others, and bind them together. But to be honest, they are not that important to us. We care more about developing the game system ... give the player new challenges for every chapter that is born.\" Although each version of Link is different to the next, an official chronology for the Zelda series was established by Nintendo, which spans thousands of years across the fictional history of Hyrule and includes three separate timelines. In celebration of The Legend of Zelda's 25th anniversary, Nintendo released (in December 2011, in Japan; in early 2013, in North America) an anthology, titled Hyrule Historia, which details The Legend of Zelda fictional timeline. Hyrule Historia explains Link's repeated incarnations in the fictional timeline by stating that the name \"Link\" is a common name in Hyrule. The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword, which was released in 2011, aimed to create an origin story, in which the antagonist Demise curses \"the spirit of the hero\" to be caught in an endless cycle of defeating evil.\n\nCharacter design\nLink's appearance has remained consistent over the course of The Legend of Zelda series but his character design has also evolved with each game release. In the original 1986 The Legend of Zelda, he appears dressed in green in a simple 2D form viewed from a top-down perspective. This was followed by a taller version of the character seen from a side-scroll perspective in the 1987 video game titled The Adventure of Link. With the release of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time in 1998, Link appeared as a 3D character. Miyamoto said that the team started by creating a grown-up model followed by a child model, but realised that they could both be used in the game, \"to tell the story of a boy growing up\". Link's teenage appearance in Ocarina of Time was designed with the aim of making him more handsome and cooler than all previous forms of the hero. Nintendo illustrator Yusuke Nakano has stated that the design of Link in Ocarina of Time was based on a well-known American actor at the time of the game's development.In 2002, Shigeru Miyamoto unveiled an anime-inspired design for Link at E3 2002, which had been created for The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. The \"Toon Link\" incarnation proved to be initially controversial and was not well received due to its childlike cartoonish style. Toon Link was originally created by graphic designer Yoshiki Haruhana as a way to evolve the series. Miyamoto commented in a 2003 interview, \"Actually we never intended to create a shockwave, it's just we were trying to make something new\". He said that after many experiments, the development team had decided that cel-shading was the best option for expressing a young, energetic boy. Toon Link would eventually carve his own identity into the franchise, appearing in multiple entries in the series and also being introduced as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Producer Eiji Aonuma explained that after the initial reaction to the new art style, gamers began to accept Toon Link, and commented, \"so after Wind Waker we created Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks with the new artwork style.\"Following the public reaction to Toon Link, Nintendo chose to completely reverse the art style for The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess in 2006. In this entry, Link was depicted in a more realistic style with a darker, grittier tone. Initially the artists planned to design Link in his mid-to-late twenties. Nintendo artists Yusuke Nakano and Satoru Takizawa discussed the design concept in the Nintendo book titled The Legend of Zelda: Art and Artifacts, in which Nakano stated, \"I wanted him to be a little bit older. The Link up till now had been in his teens, but for this one we were talking about making him around 25\u2026 maybe even 30. ... He would be well built\u2026 A skinny man with a pretty face wouldn't stand a chance against a large enemy, so we thought about making him quite sturdy.\" However, this idea was rejected, as the team expected that fans wanted to see Link as he appeared in Ocarina of Time. The design team decided to make Link a teenager again, aged 16 years. Miyamoto explained, \"So after Wind Waker we tried several different models and made varied versions of them. Ultimately we decided that in showing a teenage Link really the best style of expressing him would be something that's closer to our graphical style in Ocarina of Time.\" Eiji Aonuma explained that the design team had looked at ways of expressing Link as an older teenager, saying, \"the fact that we're seeing Link on horseback and swinging a sword, I think that's one more way in which Link has matured.\" In Twilight Princess, a key aspect of Link's role is the ability to transform into a wolf. Aonuma explained that a wolf was chosen because the design team considered the animal to be the best representation of a hero and that this function was incorporated to give the adult version of Link limited human abilities, allowing him to mature over the course of the game.\n\nLink's signature green outfit has evolved over the course of The Legend of Zelda series. At a Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, Art Director Satoru Takizawa commented on the subtle changes made to Link's outfit for each game release. He stated that for Twilight Princess he, \"made the hat long, so it would flap in the wind and move around\", however, for the release of Skyward Sword, he decided to make it more diminutive and give it less motion. The release of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild in 2017 broke the conventions of Link's design, notably the absence of his signature green outfit as a prominent feature. Takizawa explained that, \"As the graphic fidelity has increased it becomes more difficult to make that hat look cool.\" However, players can still acquire Link's green hat and tunic within the game. For Breath of the Wild nearly 100 designs were considered for Link to ensure that he remained a neutral character. Eiji Aonuma commented, \"We thought that the iconic green tunic and hat had become expected, so we wanted to mix things up and update his look. Interestingly, though, nobody on the team said, 'Let's make him blue!' It just organically ended up that way.\"Although Link is depicted as a male character, Eiji Aonuma stated that he wanted the character to be gender neutral. He said of Link's portrayal in Ocarina of Time, \"I wanted the player to think 'Maybe Link is a boy or a girl.' If you saw Link as a guy, he'd have more of a feminine touch. Or vice versa, if you related to Link as a girl, it was with more of a masculine aspect. I really wanted the designer to encompass more of a gender-neutral figure. So I've always thought that for either female or male players, I wanted them to be able to relate to Link.\" During the development of Twilight Princess, he created a more masculine version of Link, but then later decided to return Link to a more gender neutral character. Regarding Link's character design in Breath of the Wild, Aonuma stated, \"as far as gender goes, Link is definitely a male, but I wanted to create a character where anybody would be able to relate to the character.\"\n\nPortrayal\nSince the first instance of voice acting in the series (in Ocarina of Time), Link has been voiced by eight actors: Nobuyuki Hiyama in Ocarina of Time (as adult Link); Fujiko Takimoto in Ocarina of Time (as young Link), Majora's Mask, A Link to the Past and Four Swords for the Game Boy Advance and Minish Cap; Sachi Matsumoto in The Wind Waker; Akira Sasanuma in Twilight Princess; Y\u016bki Kodaira in Spirit Tracks; Takashi \u014chara in Skyward Sword; Mitsuki Saiga in A Link Between Worlds and Link's Awakening (the 2019 version only); and Kengo Takanashi in Breath of the Wild. In Tri Force Heroes, Fujiko Takimoto, Sachi Matsumoto, Y\u016bki Kodaira and Mitsuki Saiga all reprise their roles as Link, acting as alternate voices.As no canonical game in The Legend of Zelda series to date has contained substantial spoken dialogue for Link, the part consists only of short phrases, grunts, battle cries, and other sounds. In The Wind Waker, however, Link has been heard saying the phrase, \"Come on!\" Voice acting for the character has been deliberately limited to avoid contradicting players' individual interpretations of how Link could sound. Producer Eiji Aonuma stated that Link's silence is meant to avoid breaking the relationship between the player and the character that could result from adding dialogue with which the player did not agree. Link's character has been purposefully left open to interpretation to offer a blank slate for players to enter the game world and provide a more personal experience.\n\nCharacteristics\nLink is a brave, skilled warrior and the hero of The Legend of Zelda series. Over the course of the series, he has appeared in a variety of ages and forms, ranging from child to young adult, and in Twilight Princess, also appears in the form of a wolf. He displays the characteristic traits of the Hylian race, being of human form with elfin features, including pointed ears. Since the original 1986 The Legend of Zelda video game, he has been repeatedly depicted wearing his characteristic green cap and tunic. However, he has also appeared wearing other outfits, including a blue lobster shirt in The Wind Waker and his blue Champion's Tunic in Breath of the Wild. Link is described in the original game's instruction manual as a \"young lad\" and a traveller and in later games, such as Breath of the Wild, as a knight of Hyrule who is sworn to protect the kingdom and Princess Zelda. During gameplay, he carries a sword and a shield, but has also wielded a variety of other weapons, including bows, spears and axes.Link's signature weapon is the Master Sword, a powerful magic sword that has the ability to repel evil. He is also often depicted holding the Hylian Shield. These two components have become integral aspects of the character's identity. Each game in the series follows a similar story arc in which Link must take a journey that eventually leads him to recover the Master Sword, which makes him stronger in gameplay and enables him to defeat the series' main antagonist, Ganon.Throughout each game, Link is able to obtain various items during his adventures, which the player can then use in gameplay. Many of these objects possess magical properties that bestow specific abilities on Link, such as a magic cape that makes Link invisible when he wears it, or potions that replenish his health. Others have various practical purposes, such as the hookshot, which enables Link to pull items towards him, and bombs for detonation. In addition, Link has used various musical instruments on his travels, most notably, the Ocarina of Time, which when played is used for teleportation. In Breath of the Wild, Link's key tool is the Sheikah Slate, a handheld tablet featuring various runes that enable him to manipulate the game world.In Zelda lore, Link is the reincarnated soul of a hero, chosen by the goddess Hylia to protect the kingdom of Hyrule from Ganon and save Princess Zelda whenever the need arises. As the goddess' chosen hero, he is also the bearer of the Triforce of Courage, one of the three components that together combine to form the Triforce, a sacred artefact and symbol of power. In several Zelda games, Link's main objective is to recover the fragments of the Triforce in order to defeat Ganon. Link's character is always depicted as a fearless hero and a \"symbol of courage\" who is willing to protect Hyrule for the sake of others.\n\nRelationships\nLink's relationships with the other main characters has been a defining aspect of the series. Within the fictional lore, Ganon, Zelda and Link represent three pieces of the Triforce, with Ganon representing Power, Zelda representing Wisdom and Link representing Courage. This trinity transcends the fictional timeline and dictates that the three characters are destined to be forever reincarnated in an endless battle for good and evil. Link's battle with Ganon established a fictional chronology that spans across the entire series and branches into three separate timelines. The three timelines originate at the end of Ocarina of Time when the timeline splits according to whether Link successfully defeats Ganon (\"The Hero is Victorious\") or fails to stop him (the \"Fallen Hero\" timeline). The official fictional chronology was revealed in Hyrule Historia, with Skyward Sword presented as the first game in the timeline. Skyward Sword establishes that the three main characters are destined to be connected in an endless cycle after the antagonist Demise curses Link and Zelda.Link's relationship with Zelda has been a core aspect of the series but has also been the subject of speculation. Throughout the games, the storylines have suggested the possibility of a romantic relationship between the two, but this has remained ambiguous. With each game release, the nature of their relationship has varied and Link has also been presented with other possible love interests. A romantic relationship between Link and Zelda is particularly evident in Skyward Sword and was also emphasised in an official \"romance trailer\" for the game. Eiji Aonuma commented on this relationship in an interview with Game Informer, saying, \"As far as the love story goes, it wasn't that we wanted to create a romance between Link and Zelda as much as we wanted the player to feel like this is a person who's very important to me, who I need to find. We used that hint of a romance between the two to tug at the heartstrings\". In Breath of the Wild, the relationship between Link and Zelda is more complex and follows a story arc that begins with resentment and ends in a close bond with each willing to give their life for the other.\n\nAppearances and evolution\nThe Legend of Zelda series\nLink has appeared as the protagonist of The Legend of Zelda series for over three decades. In addition to appearing in every video game in The Legend of Zelda series, he has also appeared as a major character in various spin-off games. Although the plot in each Zelda game varies, most center around Link defeating Ganon with the Master Sword and rescuing Princess Zelda. During gameplay, Link must navigate through various dungeons, defeat monsters and solve puzzles before reaching the end of the game.\n\nLink was introduced on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in the original 1986 game release The Legend of Zelda. Due to the limited hardware of the era, Link was rendered as a simple 8-bit 2D character within a flat environment viewed from a top-down perspective. In the opening introduction, he meets an old man who offers him a sword and declares \"It's dangerous to go alone!\" Link is described as a \"young lad\" who saves Princess Zelda's elderly nursemaid Impa from Ganon's henchmen. Link assumes the role of the hero and must rescue Princess Zelda and the kingdom of Hyrule from the evil wizard Ganon, who has stolen the Triforce of Power. During the game, the player controls Link as he explores 128 areas of Hyrule. Nine dungeons each contain a special item that gives Link the ability to defeat that dungeon's boss; he must defeat them all before fighting Ganon.In Zelda II: The Adventure of Link (1987), Link reappeared on the NES with some minor changes to his design but still as a basic 8-bit 2D character. He is depicted as a slightly taller character sprite wearing a green outfit similar to his previous appearance. The game differs from the previous title in that it switches between a top-down perspective and a side-scroll perspective. The storyline involves Link going on a quest to place a crystal in each of six castles in Hyrule so that he can later break the magically protected Great Palace, defeat his doppelg\u00e4nger Dark Link (also known as Shadow Link), claim the Triforce of Courage, reunite the three pieces of the Triforce, and awaken sleeping Zelda. The Dark Link incarnation would later reappear in Ocarina of Time, The Oracle of Ages, Twilight Princess, and various other games.The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (1991) recreated Link in a 16-bit colour palette for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It presents the character with the unusual characteristic of pink hair, diverging from the traditional blond or light brown hair seen in other releases. Link's sprite was also designed to appear more expressive, as he was given an animated hat and a face that turns red when attempting to pull objects. The game introduced Link's Master Sword with an early design that would evolve over subsequent games. In contrast to the in-game sprite, the game manual depicts Link as a tall blond character. The story describes Link trying to intercept the wizard Agahnim before he breaks the seal on the Dark World and unleashes Ganon's fury upon Hyrule. To stop him, Link collects three magical Pendants of Virtue and claims the Master Sword, then ventures into the Dark World to rescue the Seven Sages, after which he is able to defeat Agahnim and Ganon.The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening was released in 1993 for the Game Boy, making it the first handheld title in the series. Link appeared in monochrome until the DX port brought the game to the Game Boy Color. The storyline takes place on a mysterious island called Koholint after Link is washed ashore. The game involves collecting eight musical instruments from eight dungeons in order to wake the sleeping Wind Fish, which is imprisoned inside an enormous egg. Various concepts were introduced to gameplay, including jumping and side-scrolling. Link appears in the 2019 remake The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening for the Nintendo Switch in 3D form.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (1998) was released for the Nintendo 64 (N64) and is the first 3D game in the Zelda series. It was a landmark game in terms of the detail and quality of the graphics and the influence it had on later video games. The game was the first to include Link's horse Epona. Link appears in two forms, as a younger and older version of the same character wearing his green tunic. The game is one of a few in the series that presents Link as a child, carrying the Hylian Shield and a slingshot for a weapon. The plot involves Link travelling between the present and the future by using the titular Ocarina of Time in order to stop Ganondorf's takeover of Hyrule. As a result, Link comes to be known as the \"Hero of Time\" and is successful in stopping Ganondorf both in the present and in the future. Link is accompanied by the fairy Navi, who gives him hints about enemies and his surroundings. In 2011, Link also appeared in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D, a remake of the original 1998 game for the Nintendo 3DS.Link returned in 2000 with the release of The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask on the N64. It reused character and scenery models from Ocarina of Time but added some surreal effects and colours to create a darker entry than its predecessors. The game includes four main dungeons and various side quests. In the storyline, Link appears as a child and must save the land of Termina from the evil of Majora's Mask, which has drawn the moon into a decaying orbit, threatening to crash into Termina's primary town, Clock Town, in three days. Link uses the Ocarina of Time to play the Song of Time, which allows him to repeatedly travel back in time to relive those three days until he successfully prevents the disaster. During the game, Link finds various magical masks that transform him into a Goron, Deku Scrub, or Zora. In the final boss battle with Majora, Link is transformed into Fierce Deity Link, a dark, adult version of himself with white eyes, before finally reverting to his child form. In 2015 The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D revisited the game for the Nintendo 3DS.The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages are a pair of interconnected games released in 2001 for the Game Boy Color. The two games were outsourced to a developer named Flagship and were originally designed as a trio, but the plan proved to be too complicated. Like Link's Awakening, Link is controlled from a top-down perspective within a flat 2D game world. The two games are interlinked, with completion of one game unlocking secrets within the other. The plot involves Link being sent on a mission to the foreign lands of Holodrum and Labrynna in order to stop the disruption of the seasons by the General of Darkness, Onox, and the disruption of time by the Sorceress of Shadows, Veran. Link's key tools for uncovering areas and fighting his enemies are the Rod of Seasons and his magic harp.In 2002, Nintendo published The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past & Four Swords on the Game Boy Advance. Four Swords was an original title packaged together with the rereleased entry A Link to the Past. Diverging from the traditional single-player approach, Four Swords was based on cooperative gameplay, allowing four players to interact together by connecting four Game Boy Advance systems. In Four Swords, four Links of different colours appear, each of which is controlled by a different player. The four versions of Link must then work together to complete the game's challenges.The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker was released in 2002 on the GameCube. It marked a radical change for the series and depicted Link and the game environment in a cute childlike graphical style. Link was depicted as a preteen cartoon character with a large head and huge eyes. In the storyline, Link's younger sister Aryll is kidnapped, and he embarks on a voyage to rescue her. He joins a pirate crew and travels the vast ocean to explore the many islands that are dotted around the map to encounter characters and uncover dungeons. Link's key tool is the titular Wind Waker, a magical baton that enables him to manipulate the breeze as he crosses the Great Sea. A sequel to The Wind Waker was planned but was later abandoned in favor of Twilight Princess. Nintendo artist Satoru Takizawa explained the reason for the cancellation was that \"Wind Waker 2 would have taken place in a more land-based setting, rather than on the sea, so that we could have Link gallop across the land on a horse. But Link's proportions in Wind Waker weren\u2019t very well suited for riding on horseback; he was too short, and an adult version of Toon Link did not seem appropriate either.\" In 2013 The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD revisited Link's voyage across the Great Sea on the Wii U.The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures, which was published for the GameCube in 2004, again reinterpreted traditional Zelda gameplay with a multiplayer approach. The plot centres on Link being split into four versions of himself by the Four Sword, resulting in four Links of different colours. He must embark on a quest that involves rescuing seven princesses from an evil sorcerer. The game depicts the Links in a 16-bit top-down perspective and involves each player controlling one of the four Links to explore the game world and defeat enemies in order to complete each level.The release of The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap in 2004 on the Game Boy Advance returned the series to a single-player format. Link appears as a child viewed from a top-down perspective and is tasked with saving his friend Princess Zelda. After a mysterious stranger arrives at a festival celebrating the coming of the Picori, he destroys the sacred Picori Blade and turns Zelda to stone. During the game, Link is accompanied by a magical talking cap named Ezlo, who helps him on his quest and teaches him to shrink to the size of the Minish.The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (2006) was released on the GameCube and Wii and offers a darker adventure to previous entries in the series. The game features a more detailed depiction of a teenage Link who appears ready for battle wearing chainmail beneath his tunic. In the early part of the game, he becomes trapped in the Twilight, which transforms him into a wolf. Throughout the game, he is aided by Midna, an imp-like creature, who rides on his back and helps him on his quest. The game uses a variety of animal abilities for progression, such as the ability to follow scents. Twilight Princess aimed to provide a stark contrast to the cartoonish style of The Wind Waker, presenting a game world drained of colour and a story with a more mature tone. In 2016, Link appeared in The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD, a remaster for the Wii U.The direct sequel to The Wind Waker, The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, was released in 2007 for the Nintendo DS. It follows Link as he embarks on a journey to save his friend Tetra. The game was designed to appeal to a wider audience, with 3D cel-shaded graphics and a light-hearted tone. It takes inspiration form the style and tone of The Wind Waker, with Toon Link displaying various humorous expressions. The game made use of the console's touchscreen functionality, which enabled the player to control Link using a stylus instead of the traditional button controls.Following on from Phantom Hourglass, The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks (2009) reintroduced Toon Link to the Nintendo DS. The game is a sequel to its predecessor and has a similar format but replaces sailing by boat with travelling by train. Link must explore four main map pieces, return the power of the spirit tracks using the Spirit Flute, and navigate the Spirit Tower, the main labyrinth hub, aided by the spirit of Zelda. The gameplay also incorporates the mechanic of controlling both Link and Zelda in a series of cooperative puzzles and boss battles.The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword was released on the Wii in 2011 and made use of the Wii Motion Plus as the central game mechanic, giving the player the ability to control Link's sword using motion controls. The Wii Motion Plus is used to swipe the sword in combat, control Link's mechanical beetle, and control the movements of his loftwing as he flies through the skies. The plot establishes a central timeline for the other games in the series and was designed to be an origin story for the Master Sword. It also involves a romantic relationship between Link and Zelda. The storyline begins in Skyloft, a land floating above the clouds, where Link is the childhood friend of Zelda. He is forced to descend to the surface after Zelda is kidnapped. He then travels between the two lands wielding the Goddess Sword, a magical sword that holds a spirit named Fi, who acts as his guide. During his journey, Link imbues the Goddess Sword with three sacred flames, which results in it being reforged into the Master Sword. Link also appears in The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD (2021), a remastered version of the game for the Nintendo Switch.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds was released in 2013 for the Nintendo 3DS and is a sequel to A Link to the Past. The plot revolves around a sorcerer named Yuga who has the ability to merge into walls and turn people into paintings. Link must foil his plan to revive Ganon. The storyline is set within the same world as A Link to the Past and was designed with a similar art style. Players are able to explore the two separate worlds of Hyrule and Lorule, which are reminiscent of the contrasting worlds of light and dark in A Link to the Past. The game introduced the ability for Link to turn into a painting, allowing him to walk along walls and switch between the two worlds.The Legend of Zelda: Tri Force Heroes (2015) was the second original Zelda entry for the Nintendo 3DS and a departure from the series' tradition, with a focus on a three-player cooperative campaign. Link appears alongside two companions that can be stacked to reach high places, solve puzzles and defeat tall enemies. The storyline revolves around the theme of fashion and is set in the realm of Hytopia, where a witch has cursed Princess Styla to wear an ugly brown body suit. As a result, the Hytopian king calls for adventurers to break the curse. The gameplay departs from the usual Zelda open-world structure and involves completing dungeons and collecting materials to fashion outfits that provide specific abilities.The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was released on the Nintendo Switch and Wii U in 2017 and reinvented the franchise with significant changes to visuals and gameplay. It moved away from the rigid structure of preceding games and created a massive open world for Link to explore. He has the ability to climb most surfaces, allowing the player to explore the vast terrain. The addition of a paraglider also gives Link the ability to jump from structures and soar across the sky. Link was also designed to interact with the surrounding environment, collecting materials for cooking and reacting to cold and heat. The game introduced significant changes to Link's design, notably the absence of his signature green outfit. It allows players to dress Link in a variety of outfits, including his blue Champion's Tunic, and places more emphasis on his bow as a prominent weapon. The storyline centers around Link waking without his memories after a century in a stasis pod called the \"Shrine of Resurrection\" and discovering that Calamity Ganon has taken control of Hyrule Castle and that Hyrule has fallen into ruin.Link is due to appear in Breath of the Wild's currently-untitled sequel in Spring 2023. Nintendo released a teaser trailer as part of its E3 2021 Nintendo Direct, showing an altered version of Link from Breath of the Wild. The upcoming game is a direct sequel to the previous game and is set in the same version of Hyrule.\n\nSpin-off games\nIn 1989, Link appeared in Zelda, which was released in the Game & Watch series of handheld electronic games. The unit features a multi-screen liquid-crystal display (LCD). The lower display is used for the main gameplay which involves Link fighting against dungeon monsters, while the upper display features the inventory and another small game screen. The gameplay of the Game & Watch unit ZL-65 is simpler than that of an NES game and features a story that replaces Ganon with eight dragons that kidnap Zelda. After battling through a dungeon, Link must defeat a dragon on the upper screen to receive a piece of the Triforce, before freeing Zelda with the eight recovered Triforce pieces.1989 was also the release year of The Legend of Zelda Game Watch, which was part of the LCD wristwatch product line licensed to and developed by Nelsonic Industries. In addition to its timekeeping function, the unit features gameplay based on the original The Legend of Zelda game but without a storyline. It features Link adventuring through eight dungeons comprising four rooms in each.Link appears in Zelda no Densetsu: Kamigami no Triforce (Barcode Battler II), which was released by Epoch Co. in 1992 in Japan but not in North America. It was developed for the Barcode Battler II console and involves swiping cards to unlock various characters from A Link to the Past.In 1993 and 1996, Link appeared in Link: The Faces of Evil, Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon and Zelda's Adventure, although he is playable only in The Faces of Evil and relegated to a secondary role in The Wand of Gamelon and Zelda's Adventure. At the beginning of The Faces of Evil, Link and the King of Hyrule are visited by a wizard named Gwonam, who tells them that Ganon and his servants have seized the peaceful island of Koridai and captured Zelda. After being informed that only he can defeat Ganon, Link travels to Koridai to find the magical artifact known as the Book of Koridai. In the latter two games, the roles are reversed and Zelda has to rescue Link from Ganon. While the comics were licensed by Nintendo to use official Zelda characters, none of them were produced or supervised by Nintendo. As well as being critically panned, none of these games (which were produced for the Philips CD-i multimedia player) are recognized by Nintendo as part of the series' official chronology. Unlike the main games, Link has the ability to speak and is voiced by Jeffrey Rath. His personality mirrors his animated series counterpart in which he yearns for adventure and is constantly trying to get a kiss from Zelda.In 2007, Nintendo released a shooting video game for the Wii titled Link's Crossbow Training. It is set within the Zelda universe and features Link as a playable character holding a crossbow. The game revisits the world of Twilight Princess and features the same landmarks and enemies. It involves the use of the Wii remote and nunchuck to create a light gun, which targets enemies with an onscreen reticule.Link appears in the 2014 hack and slash video game Hyrule Warriors as a playable character. This incarnation is a Hyrulian soldier-in-training who helps to lead the campaign against the forces of evil. Young Link from Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask also appears in the game as a playable character via downloadable content, while Toon Link from The Wind Waker appears as a playable character in Hyrule Warriors Legends, the Nintendo 3DS port of Warriors.Link also appears as a playable character in the 2019 Nintendo Switch rhythm game Cadence of Hyrule, a crossover between Crypt of the NecroDancer and The Legend of Zelda series.In 2020, Link reappeared as a playable character in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, which acts as a prequel to Breath of the Wild and exists within the same game world. Link's appearance is similar to this previous incarnation and includes the same game mechanics featured in Breath of the Wild, such as the use of the Sheikah Slate and the ability to use a sword and a shield for parrying. He is accompanied by a roster of characters to fight alongside on the battlefield. The storyline centres around Zelda struggling to unlock her powers and the Champions battling against the newly resurrected Ganon. The game progresses in the form of various missions that must be completed to level up Link and his allies.For the 35th anniversary of The Legend of Zelda series, Nintendo released Game & Watch: The Legend of Zelda in 2021. The unit was designed with a green colour scheme, metallic gold front plate and light up Triforce on the reverse. It includes the original The Legend of Zelda game, Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, Link's Awakening and also a version of the 1980 Game & Watch title Vermin which features Link in the main role. The clock function also depicts Link fighting various enemies.\n\nOther game series\nLink has appeared in other game series and his weapons and outfits have also appeared in several games. A reference to Link appears in the Japanese release of the NES game Final Fantasy, where a grave in Elfheim is marked \"Here lies Link\". Among SNES games, Link makes a cameo in Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest where he is ranked against the player next to Mario and Yoshi. Alongside Samus Aran, he makes a cameo in Super Mario RPG, where they are seen sleeping in separate beds at an inn.He is a playable character in the Super Smash Bros. series and has appeared in every title since the first Super Smash Bros. on the Nintendo 64. In 2008, Toon Link from The Wind Waker appeared in Super Smash Bros. Brawl on the Wii. He was also introduced in 2014 in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. Link later returned in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate for the Nintendo Switch in various incarnations, including Young Link, Toon Link, green tunic Link and the version wearing his blue tunic from Breath of the Wild.In the GameCube version of Namco's Soulcalibur II, Link is a featured character and wields his signature weapons from the Zelda series. Miyamoto did not see a problem with Link appearing in what some had thought to be a \"violent fighting game\", as he had already been established as a fighter in the Super Smash Bros. series. Link was planned to appear together with Metroid series protagonist Samus Aran in Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, but was later removed. As part of the styling of a Zelda-themed game mode, he is featured in the 2006 puzzle video game Tetris DS. In Scribblenauts Unlimited, many Zelda series characters are summonable in the Wii U version, including Link. He is referenced by an archer dressed in green in The Legend of Zelda: Battle Quest, a mini game in the 2012 party game Nintendo Land, which involves archery and sword fighting in a cloth style. His signature green outfit also appears alongside that of Samus in Dynasty Warriors VS for the Nintendo 3DS. Link appears in Sonic Lost World as part of \"The Legend of Zelda Zone\", where he rides his signature Crimson Loftwing. In the 2013 compilation game NES Remix, players can play remixed portions of NES games, including playing as Link in a level of Donkey Kong.The Skyward Sword incarnation of Link was introduced as a playable character in Mario Kart 8, along with the \"Hyrule Circuit\" race track, the \"Triforce Cup\" and a vehicle set consisting of the \"Master Cycle\", \"Triforce Tires\" and \"Hylian Kite\". In Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, the Breath of the Wild incarnation also appears, along with the Master Cycle Zero, Ancient Tires, and Paraglider from the same game.

The Master Sword and Hylian Shield appear alongside Link's Champion's Tunic from Breath of the Wild as Amiibo-unlocked content in the Nintendo Switch version of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. In 2019, Link was added as a playable character in the 2.0.0 update to Super Mario Maker 2, which features the Master Sword power-up changing the Mario characters into Link.\n\nTelevision series\nIn The Legend of Zelda animated series, Link, voiced by Jonathan Potts, features in a set of cartoons which aired from 1989 to 1990 as a part of DIC's The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!. Based loosely on the first game, the cartoons present Link as a rude, lovesick teenager. The plot revolves around Link living in Hyrule Castle and being recruited to protect the Triforce of Wisdom from Ganon, while accompanied by a fairy princess named Spryte. Over the course of the series he persistently attempts to kiss Zelda and exclaims the catchphrase \"Well excuuuuuse me, Princess!\" when tired with her attitude. Thirteen episodes were produced before the cancellation of The Super Mario Bros. Super Show.A similar version of Link and Zelda appear during the second season of Captain N: The Game Master. The storyline involves a character named Kevin being sucked into a TV and entering a game world. During three episodes, he helps Link and Zelda to stop Ganon from reviving to protect the Triforce.Throughout 2013 and 2014, Link appeared in a series of comedic shorts titled The Legend of Zelda: The Misadventures of Link. The series made its debut on Nintendo Video, a video on demand service for the Nintendo 3DS. The series was based on The Wind Waker HD and aimed to present Link \"in a new and hysterical light.\"In 2015, news of a planned live-action series based on The Legend of Zelda was widely reported online. According to comedian Adam Conover, the proposed series was cancelled by Nintendo after someone from Netflix leaked the project.\n\nComics and manga\nFollowing the release of the original game, Link appeared in manga-style novels published by Futabasha, including The Legend of Zelda: The Mirage Castle, which was published in Japanese in 1986.In the early 1990s, Valiant Comics published a serial comic based on The Legend of Zelda series. The comic series lasted for only five issues, with a sixth story published as part of the Nintendo Comics System. In this incarnation, Link's appearance was based on the original video game, giving him red hair, instead of his typical blonde or brown hair. However, the storyline reflects The Legend of Zelda animated television series, which was being aired around the same time. Link and Zelda's relationship is depicted as amorous, with Link attempting to get a kiss from Zelda and Zelda returning Link's affections.A serial comic was created for Nintendo Power magazine by Japanese manga artist Shotaro Ishinomori. It was published in 1992 and later collected in graphic novel form in 1993. The plot is an alternate version of the storyline from A Link to the Past. Several other manga adaptations have been published by Viz Media based on the Zelda video games, including Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, A Link to the Past and The Minish Cap, which were illustrated by Akira Himekawa. The Japanese artist duo also wrote the long-running Twilight Princess manga, which began as a Japanese serialisation in 2016 followed by an English translation in 2017 and has been released as a series of volumes.Nintendo published Link's Hijinks, a translated web comic by Saitaro Komatsu on its Play Nintendo website. The comic had originally appeared in the Japanese manga magazine CoroCoro Comic.\n\nGamebooks\nNintendo published several gamebooks based on The Legend of Zelda series. As part of the Nintendo Adventure Book series, which was similar to the Choose Your Own Adventure books, two books were published in 1992 titled The Crystal Trap and The Shadow Prince. In The Crystal Trap, the storyline involves Zelda saving Link from the trap, while in The Shadow Prince, Link must save Zelda with the help of a character named Charles. In 2001, two books based on The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages were published by Scholastic, which were written by Craig Wessel and feature Link in a storyline based on the video games.\n\nReception\nCritical reception\nLink has been well received by video game critics. In a section titled \"top ten forces of good\" in their 2004 list of top 50 retro game heroes, Retro Gamer noted that Link is \"one of the longest running gaming legends.\" Game Informer chose Link as the number one \"Hero of 2006\". CNET declared him the second top comic book character of all time in 2009. UGO.com ranked Link in first place on a list of comic book characters who need their own movies, adding, \"Get Peter Jackson or Guillermo del Toro to do it, dump a ton of money into it, and we'll all die happy.\" In 2013, Complex ranked him as the sixth \"most badass\" comic book character of all time, as well as the fourth best video game mascot of all time. GamesRadar staff ranked Link as one their \"100 best heroes in video games\", published in 2013. In 2020, Esquire listed Link in \"The 50 Best Video Game Characters of All Time\". In 2021, Riley McAtee for The Ringer opined, \"A mute but courageous hero was the perfect character for a fantasy adventure game in the 1980s. Some 35 years later, video game storytelling has evolved, as has the Legend of Zelda franchise. But Link hasn't. He hasn't needed to. He's been the perfect video game character all along.\" Chris Morgan for Yardbarker described Link as one of \"the most memorable characters from old school Nintendo games\". HobbyConsolas included Link in \"The 30 best heroes of the last 30 years,\" while Rachel Weber of GamesRadar ranked Link as 7th of their \"50 iconic video game characters.\"The character is also popular among the video game fan community. In the 1988 and 1989 Nintendo Power Awards, readers voted him as the best character. He was also voted by readers as the first and third \"Best Hero\" in the 1993 and 1994 Nintendo Power Awards respectively. In one of IGN's 2007 Hero Showdowns and in Screw Attack's Death Battle, Link was voted the favorite over Cloud Strife. In 2010, Nintendo Power chose Link as their second favorite hero, commenting that his courage always wins out over evil.Link has also proven to be a popular guest character in other video games series. In 2008, IGN ranked him as the best bonus character in the Soul Calibur series, while GameDaily ranked him first on a list of top ten Smash Bros. characters. Polygon's Jeremy Parish ranked 73 fighters from Super Smash Bros. Ultimate from \"garbage to glorious,\" praising Toon Link and placing him in seventh place unlike his other character incarnations, and stating that Toon Link is another version of Link \"but this one is also the single most expressive fighter on the Smash roster.\" Gavin Jasper of Den of Geek also praised and ranked Link as sixth on his list of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate characters, and stated that \"I really like that he's functionally the exact same as his Smash predecessors despite being a different Link. It's really what I see as the soul of Link himself. He's not just a generic hero, but a force of pure mythology.\"Critics and gamers have also commented on Link's sexual attractiveness. In June 2006, Link was chosen as the \"Hottest Video Game Character\" by Out magazine for his appearance in Twilight Princess, describing him as \"Nintendo's sexy farm-boy-turned-wolf\". A survey conducted from December 2019 to November 2020 placed Link in top position of a list of the sexiest male video game characters based on 20 fan sources and Google search data. Brian Feldman for New York magazine remarked, \"For three decades, gamers have been horny for Link, and finally, Nintendo has acknowledged that Link is a hot, sexy boy who will fight for your honor\" and highlighted that this aspect of Link is particularly emphasised by the reactions of several side characters in Breath of the Wild.  The relationship between Link and Princess Zelda was also ranked as the number one video game romance by James Hawkins of Joystick Division, who commented, \"Never overtly called-out and not yet actualized, this tacit romance has shaped one of gaming's greatest franchises.\"\n\nCritical commentary\nLink's character has been the subject of critical commentary with regards to his role as the protagonist of the series. Kyle Wizner for Screen Rant commented on Link's character as a silent protagonist, stating that Breath of the Wild's attempt at a more compelling story was, \"successful in some regards\", but \"the most significant problem with Link as a main character is also the most obvious: He doesn't speak. The silent protagonist is a gaming trope as old as any, but as it becomes less common in the modern era of video games, its issues become more obvious.\" However, in a 2016 interview Eiji Aonuma gave an opinion about giving Link a voice, saying, \"while in some ways I do feel that it could be good to have a game where he speaks, part of me also feels that that air of proud independence he has because he doesn't speak is a precious part of the individuality of his character.\"Writing for Den of Geek, Ryan Lambie described Link's character as \"the videogame equivalent of Tintin\" because he is \"the archetypal young hero, embodying all the optimism, generosity and spirit of adventure a broad fantasy action game requires. And just as Tintin's simple design served as a reader's entry point into Herg\u00e9's stories, Link acts as the player's eyes and ears in Hyrule, a filter through which audiences can experience the colourful characters, action and perils the world constantly introduces.\" He further commented that Link is one of the most enduring video game characters because he is \"a sympathetic hero\" and \"the ultimate videogame underdog. He really is an ordinary yet brave little guy who wants to save the world, in spite of insurmountable odds.\"Sara Gitkos for iMore questioned Link's role as the series protagonist, despite Zelda being the titular character. She commented that since the start of the series, \"Zelda served as the prize at the end of Link's long traveled tunnel\" and played the role of the damsel in distress, although in recent games, she has \"acted more as a partner to Link rather than an object to save\". However, she also noted that it would be difficult to change this because, \"Though players take control of Link and he \"acts\" as the protagonist, the silent hero is really just the vessel for players to control. He doesn't have any character to speak of, but rather is the place holder for us, and we become him.\"In 2016, video game websites GameSpot and Kotaku consulted Eiji Aonuma regarding the possibility of producing a Zelda game led by a female version of Link. Aonuma responded by stating, \"We thought about it and decided that if we're going to have a female protagonist, it's simpler to have Princess Zelda as the main character.\" However, this idea was abandoned because \"if we have Princess Zelda as the main character who fights, then what is Link going to do?\" Jacob Krastenakes writing for The Verge opined, \"Switching the two characters wouldn't even require Link to be completely absent \u2014 he could simply be the other character, who is off doing their own thing.\" Aonuma also referred to the balance of the Triforce as a reason for not creating a female Link, stating, \"The Triforce is made up of Princess Zelda, Ganon, and Link. Princess Zelda is obviously female. If we made Link a female we thought that would mess with the balance of the Triforce. That's why we decided not to do it.\" In 2015, Nintendo announced a female version of Link named Linkle for the 2016 Nintendo 3DS release Hyrule Warriors Legends. Miyamoto confirmed that Link would continue to be the main character of the series in an interview with Game Kult, stating, \"in the classic games in the series, Link is the hero and that will not change.\"Jonathan Homes writing for Destructoid commented on the ambiguity of Link's character, asking, \"Is Link an individual, or is he (or she) a blank slate avatar meant to represent the player?\" He continued by stating, \"Nintendo has done an admirable job of concocting a way to help fans to imagine Link as both a specific person and an abstract concept at the same time. He\u2019s actually not always named Link. You, the player, choose his name before starting each of his games. He also never speaks, further solidifying him as non-character who's only purpose is to act as doorway for the player into the game world. Yet, by leaning hard on both the reincarnation myth and the use of multiple timelines, Nintendo has managed to shape Link into a series of individual characters in the minds of many.\"\n\nLegacy\nAs the mascot of The Legend of Zelda series, Link has become a widely recognisable character in pop culture. Due to his popularity with gamers, his signature green outfit combined with the Master Sword and Hylian Shield is a popular choice with fans for cosplay. His image has been recreated in numerous works of fan art. He has been the subject of numerous internet memes that focus on the common misconception that Link is named Zelda due to him being the protagonist of the series. He has also appeared in the form of various merchandise, including figurines, Amiibo, plush toys, and apparel. Guinness World Records reported that as of 1 February 2018, Link is the most prolific Nintendo character released as an Amiibo, with 11 different versions, including Toon Link, Wolf Link and Link (Rider) from Breath of the Wild. Since the release of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate on 7 December 2018, he also holds the Guinness World Record as the most ubiquitous action-adventure video game character, having appeared in 40 unique video games, not including rereleases and HD remasters.\n\nIn 2001, the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition recognised Link as the second best video game character of all time, behind Mario. In 2005, he was awarded a star on the Walk of Game along with his creator, Shigeru Miyamoto. In 2011, Empire ranked Link as the sixth greatest comic book character, stating \"Shigeru Miyamoto's most famous creation aside from a certain moustachioed plumber, Link has grown into one of the world's most celebrated console heroes, and helped establish RPGs as an international gaming standard.\" In 2017, Time named Link as 11th on its \"Most Influential Video Game Characters of All Time\", stating, \"The protagonist of each The Legend of Zelda series installment, Link embodies the selfless hero on a transformative journey, a storytelling trope we've seen in countless titles from Mass Effect's Commander Shepard to Halo's Master Chief.\" On 26 October 2018, Guinness World Records named Link as the \"most critically acclaimed videogame playable character\", as he has appeared in six unique entries in GameRankings.com's list of the top 100 all-time best reviewed videogames, with Nintendo's Super Mario and Konami's Solid Snake being his closest competitors. In 2020, James McMahon for The Independent listed Link in fourth place in the \"Top 20 most iconic video game characters of all time\", commenting, \"You star in over 19 instalments of what's largely considered the greatest RPG series of all time. In your own animated TV series. Your own manga. Your own board game (three of those actually). Not only that, but one of your last rides out \u2013 2017's Breath of the Wild \u2013 is frequently discussed in the conversation entitled, \"What's the Greatest Video Game Ever?\" And after all this? You're not only not Nintendo's most famous character \u2013 you don't even get your name in the title of the franchise you've helmed since 1986! The Legend of Link perhaps doesn't have the same ring to it, but it's the little green one who runs this manor, not Zelda.\"\n\nSee also\nCharacters of The Legend of Zelda\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nLink on Play.Nintendo.com",
    "Prince Sidon": "Prince Sidon ( SY-don) is a fictional character in Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda series. He first appeared as a major character in the 2017 action-adventure game The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. He reappears as a playable character in the 2020 hack-and-slash video game Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity. Sidon is the Prince of the Zora, an amphibious race, and is the younger brother of Mipha, who is one of the four Champions who help Princess Zelda and Link fight against Calamity Ganon. In Breath of the Wild, Sidon helps Link to reach Divine Beast Vah Ruta so that he gain control of its ancient power to defeat Ganon. Since his first appearance, Sidon has received an overwhelmingly positive reception from both fans and critics. Due to his muscular physique, boundless enthusiasm, and gleaming white smile, he has achieved a large fan following and has also been the subject of numerous works of fan art and memes on social media.\n\nConcept and creation\nProducer Eiji Aonuma and game director Hidemaro Fujibayashi have commented on the popularity of Sidon and have stated that they enjoy Sidon's enthusiasm. Fujibayashi said that during the development of Sidon's character, \"he was kind of overly enthusiastic at first\". He went on to explain, \"We thought it was a bit too much, but as we adjusted his dialogue and improved it, we also came to love his character. So, where he ended up, it makes a lot of sense that people like him.\"\n\nCharacter design\nSidon bears the typical fantastical design traits of the Zora, being a humanoid character with features that resemble a fish. He is primarily red or dark pink in colour, with a tail fin sprouting from the top of his head. Eiji Aonuma has commented on his design, stating, \"Actually, the initial colour of Prince Sidon's body was blue, but since he's meant to be Mipha's brother, he obviously wouldn't have looked like a sibling. That's why we gave him a pink-ish colour.\" Artist Yuko Miyakawa stated in development notes that he had been asked to create the character as, \"a passionate, dignified and powerful character with a stronger physique than other Zora\" and based his design on a hammerhead shark. As a member of the Zora race, Sidon is taller than the average Hyrulean, but he is also tall by Zora standards. Due to the slow age rate of the Zora, Sidon is a young man with an age of 135 years. Like the other Zora, Sidon wears little clothing, but his attire does feature several items that reflect his status as prince of the Zora, such as his scarf, decorated shoulder pads, bracelets and belt.\n\nPortrayal\nSidon is voiced in English by James D. Mortellaro in Breath of the Wild and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity. He is voiced by Kosuke Onishi in Japanese.\n\nCharacteristics\nSidon is the prince of the amphibious Zora and a strong leader of his people. He is also the best swimmer of his race. His friendly, brave and optimistic personality is reflected in his tendency to strike poses during gameplay. He has also been noted for his muscular physique and his gleaming white smile, which have resulted in many fans treating him like a heart-throb. His affable personality means that he is well liked by the Zora people. Sidon is the son of King Dorephan, the ruler of Zora's Domain, which means that he is the next in line as ruler. He displays a great deal of respect for his older sister, Mipha, which provides an emotional element to his storyline. They share a deep bond, which is expressed in one of The Champion's Ballad cutscenes for Breath of the Wild in which Mipha helps baby Sidon to glide up a waterfall in Zora's Domain and tells him, \"I believe in you\". He sometimes displays moments of grief during gameplay when the death of his sister is mentioned in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity.\n\nAppearances\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\nSidon plays a major role in the gameplay of Breath of the Wild as a supportive character to Link. When Link reaches Zora's Domain in Breath of the Wild, he is greeted by Sidon, who holds Link in high regard. Sidon is a friendly ally to Link in his quest to defeat Waterblight Ganon and gain control of Divine Beast Vah Ruta. He provides words of encouragement to Link in gameplay, such as \"I believe in you, Link!\" Before Link can enter Divine Beast Vah Ruta, he rides on the back of Sidon to be transported along the surface of the water in Zora's Domain in order to reach the Divine Beast. After Link gains control of Vah Ruta, Sidon expresses his gratitude and admiration for Link. Sidon also appears in a cutscene in The Champion's Ballad, the second DLC pack for Breath of the Wild. The cutscene takes the form of a flashback in the storyline, which depicts Sidon as a baby with his sister Mipha. In the storyline of Breath of the Wild, the player learns that Mipha is one of the four Champions who helps Zelda and Link to fight against Calamity Ganon 100 years earlier, but loses her life during the battle. In the present day, Sidon is depicted bowing his head in mourning at night while standing before her memorial statue in Zora's Domain.\n\nHyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity\nSidon returns as a playable character in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity. During battle, he wields the Zora spear, a weapon that is also used by his sister, Mipha. He can also wield two Ceremonial Tridents and manipulate water to create a powerful attack on surrounding enemies. During gameplay he moves around by riding on a shark created out of water. He can also propel bombs by hitting them with his trident. The storyline takes place 100 years before the events in Breath of the Wild when Calamity Ganon launches an attack on Hyrule. After Zelda's small Guardian Terrako travels back to the past through a time portal, Zelda must gather allies to help defeat Ganon. The storyline involves a cutscene in which Sidon arrives from the future to heroically defend Mipha against Waterblight Ganon while declaring that she will not be taken from him again. The scene reflects upon the tragedy of Mipha's death in the separate timeline, the strength of their bond and the tragedy of the brother and sister never again being together.\n\nReception\nSince his appearance in Breath of the Wild, reception for Prince Sidon has been overwhelmingly positive. Madeline Carpou for Screen Rant included Sidon in sixth place on a list of the \"10 biggest himbos in video games\", describing him as, \"a beefcake with standards, going out of his way to help Link in his journey and making sure to flex all the while.\" Susanna Polo for Polygon commented \"Sidon's appeal had already been emphatically communicated to me by Twitter, Tumblr and...basically any place that fans of the game post fan art and screenshots of the large, encouraging, friendly Zora prince. I couldn't miss him anywhere I went.\" Michael McWhertor for Polygon opined that \"Sidon is notable for his enthusiasm and swimming ability\" but also \"famous for his smoldering sex appeal.\" GameSpot commented on Sidon's character by stating, \"Prince Sidon is anything but a regal jerk; he's actually the most endearing, high-spirited dork you'll find in Hyrule. Just look at that bicep pose and twinkling smile. It's no wonder the internet has fallen in love with him.\" Due to Sidon's popularity as a character, he has been the subject of numerous works of fan art, tweets and memes that have centred around his sexual attractiveness. Paste writer Holly Green included Prince Sidon on her \"the best new game characters of 2017\".Sidon has also received positive comments about the impact of his character and his performance in gameplay. Polygon ranked Sidon among the 70 best video game characters of the 2010s decade. Michael Christopher for The Gamer opined that in Breath of the Wild Sidon is, \"one of the most notable characters in the game\". Jessica Filby for Screen Rant included Sidon in sixth place on a list of Breath of the Wild characters based on likability, describing him as, \"a well-respected and popular character\" and noting his \"endless optimism and care for Link.\" Renan Fontes for GameRant remarked on Sidon's appearance in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, stating, \"As was the case in Breath of the Wild, Sidon is the standout modern Champion. Not only is he the most fun to play as gameplay wise, his scenes with Mipha are genuinely heartbreaking.\" Jake Koran for Screen Rant described Sidon as \"incredible\" in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, commenting that \"Sidon's unique action is one of the most powerful in the game.\" Daniel Alexander for The Gamer ranked Sidon in first place on a list of \"The 10 Best New Characters In Breath Of The Wild\" noting \"his determination and courage\" and \"his endless optimism and dedication to saving both Zora's Domain and Hyrule\". CJ Andriessen of Destructoid opined that Sidon deserves his own game by commenting, \"He has arguably the most exciting of the Divine Beast action sequences\" and also stated, \"I can\u2019t remember the last time a character absolutely radiated sunshine with every move he made and every word he said\". Sara Heritage for The Gamer ranked Sidon in first place on a list that ranked every side character in The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild, commenting, \"Upon reveal in 2017, his smile was so bright it instantly became a meme leading up to the game's release. Smart, dashing and emotionally available, this mourning prince sums up everything good in the world of Hyrule.\"\n\nSee also\nCharacters of The Legend of Zelda\n\n\n== References ==",
    "Nintendo Switch": "The Nintendo Switch is a video game console developed by Nintendo and released worldwide in most regions on March 3, 2017. The console itself is a tablet that can either be docked for use as a home console or used as a portable device, making it a hybrid console. Its wireless Joy-Con controllers, with standard buttons and directional analog sticks for user input, motion sensing, and tactile feedback, can attach to both sides of the console to support handheld-style play. They can also connect to a grip accessory to provide a traditional home console gamepad form, or be used individually in the hand like the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, supporting local multiplayer modes. The Nintendo Switch's software supports online gaming through Internet connectivity, as well as local wireless ad hoc connectivity with other consoles. Nintendo Switch games and software are available on both physical flash-based ROM cartridges and digital distribution via Nintendo eShop; the system has no region lockout. A handheld-focused revision of the system, called the Nintendo Switch Lite, was released on September 20, 2019. A revised higher-end version of the original system, featuring an OLED screen, was released on October 8, 2021.\nThe Nintendo Switch was unveiled on October 20, 2016. Known in development by its codename NX, the concept of the Switch came about as Nintendo's reaction to several quarters of financial losses into 2014, attributed to poor sales of its previous console, the Wii U, and market competition from mobile games. Nintendo's then-president Satoru Iwata pushed the company towards mobile gaming and novel hardware. The Nintendo Switch's design is aimed at a wide demographic of video game players through multiple modes of use. Nintendo opted to use more standard electronic components, such as a chipset based on Nvidia's Tegra line, to make development for the console easier for programmers and more compatible with existing game engines. As the Wii U had struggled to gain external support, leaving it with a weak software library, Nintendo preemptively sought the support of many third-party developers and publishers to help build out the Switch's game library alongside Nintendo's first-party titles, including many independent video game studios. While Nintendo initially anticipated around 100 titles for its first year, over 320 titles from first-party, third-party, and independent developers were released by the end of 2017.\nAs an eighth-generation console, the Nintendo Switch competes with Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4. Nearly three million console units were shipped in its first month, exceeding Nintendo's initial projection of two million and within a year of release achieved over 14 million units sold worldwide, outselling total lifetime sales of the Wii U. By the start of 2018, the Switch became the fastest-selling home or hybrid console in both Japan and the United States. As of March 2022, all Nintendo Switch models have sold nearly 108 million units worldwide, making it Nintendo's best-selling home console and the fifth-bestselling game console of all time. Sales of the Switch have been strongly tied to sales of Nintendo's first-party titles, with six games\u2014The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Super Mario Odyssey, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield, and Animal Crossing: New Horizons\u2014having sold over twenty million units each.\n\nHistory\nBackground\nNintendo had seen record revenues, net sales, and profits in 2009 as a result of the release of the Nintendo DS and Wii in 2004 and 2006, respectively, but in Nintendo's subsequent years, its revenues had declined. The company had posted its first loss as a video game company in 2012 prior to the Wii U's introduction that year and would have similar losses in the following years due to the console's poor uptake. The New York Times attributed Nintendo lowering financial forecasts in 2014 to weak hardware sales against mobile gaming. Previously, the company had been hesitant about this market, with then-president Satoru Iwata considering that they would \"cease to be Nintendo\" and lose their identity if they attempted to enter it. About three years prior to the Switch's announcement, Iwata, Tatsumi Kimishima, Genyo Takeda, and Shigeru Miyamoto crafted a strategy for revitalizing Nintendo's business model, which included approaching the mobile market, creating new hardware, and \"maximizing [their] intellectual property\". Prior to his death, Iwata was able to secure a business alliance with Japanese mobile provider DeNA to develop mobile titles based on Nintendo's first-party franchises, believing this approach would not compromise their integrity. Following Iwata's death in July 2015, Kimishima was named as president of Nintendo, while Miyamoto was promoted to the title of \"Creative Fellow\".\n\nDevelopment\nThe initial conception for the Switch started shortly after the release of the Wii U in 2012. Kimishima stated that when Nintendo was evaluating what new hardware they wanted to produce, they \"didn't just want a successor\" to either the Nintendo 3DS or Wii U, but instead asked \"what kind of new experience can we create?\" In an interview with Asahi Shimbun, Kimishima stated that the Switch was designed to provide a \"new way to play\" that would \"have a larger impact than the Wii U\". Nintendo of America president and COO Reggie Fils-Aim\u00e9 emphasized the console's appeal as a device that would provide gamers the option to play at home or on the go and noted that it would enable developers to create new types of games. This approach continued Nintendo's  blue ocean strategy for the competitive console marketplace, as rather than compete feature for feature with the other consoles, they would establish unique and difficult-to-copy devices. Miyamoto said that some broad concepts of the Switch extend from the \"lateral thinking with seasoned technology\" design philosophy of Gunpei Yokoi that Nintendo has used over the last couple of decades.The commercial failure of the Wii U also pressured Nintendo in the Switch's development. Early sales of the Wii U were weak compared to the Wii, and major third-party studios like Electronic Arts and Ubisoft announced they would not support the console near the end of the Wii U's first year, further hampering its sales. According to Fils-Aim\u00e9, when it became apparent that the Wii U's life cycle performance would underperform the company's expectations, the Switch became a \"make or break product\" for Nintendo.The design of the Switch was aimed to bridge the polarization of the gaming market at the time, creating a device that could play \"leisurely\" video games along with games that are aimed to be played \"deeply\", according to Shinya Takahashi and Yoshiaki Koizumi, general manager and deputy general manager of Nintendo's Entertainment Planning & Development Division (EPD), respectively. This approach also would apply to the cultural lifestyle and gaming differences between Japanese and Western players; Japanese players tend to play on the go and with social groups, while Western players tend to play at home by themselves. The design of the Switch would meet both cultures, and certain games, like 1-2-Switch, could potentially make social gaming more acceptable in Western culture. Two key elements that were set to address this mixed market were the ability for the unit to play either on a television screen or as a portable and the use of detachable controllers. The \"Switch\" name was selected not only to refer to the console's ability to switch from handheld to home console modes, but to present \"the idea of being a 'switch' that will flip and change the way people experience entertainment in their daily lives\".Part of the inspiration of the Switch's form and design was from feedback players had given Nintendo on the Wii Remote, according to Shinya Takahashi. With the release of games like Wii Sports and Wii Fit, players had asked Nintendo if they could make the Wii Remote in a smaller form factor, potentially strapped to a part of their body. This led to Nintendo envisioning what a smaller form-factor controller could provide in both hardware and gameplay, and it led to the idea of a console that was small enough with these new controllers to also be portable. Other concepts came out of critical consumer feedback of the Wii U. Fils-Aim\u00e9 said that one common criticism they had for the Wii U was that while players did enjoy using the Wii U GamePad and would want to play games on it anywhere, it became functionless if they moved a distance away from the main console. This served for Nintendo to design a home console that the player could take with them anywhere. Around five different prototypes were developed for the Switch before they finalized on the released design. This included developing different methods of how the Joy-Con controllers would physically connect to the console, including using magnets to hold them in place.In addition to the form-factor design, Nintendo needed to balance the power and speed of the console's central processing unit with battery life and the unit's size, coupled with limited development resources and deadlines set by Nintendo's management. One choice made by the development team was to use an existing system on a chip (SOC) rather than creating their own as they had done on previous consoles. Koizumi said that this break from tradition was done to gain more third-party support for the console by using an SOC to which developers could easily port games. Nintendo was not focused on raw processing power but was instead looking to balance the overall features of the system, including battery life and size, as well as keeping in mind their limited development resources and timeline. Koizumi said, \"The most difficult part was on how to take an overall balance while we were getting entangled with all of those in complexity.\" To achieve this balance, they did not opt to use the more powerful hardware they could have used, instead using a middle-ground approach to achieve their vision of the Switch.Koizumi served as the general producer of the Switch during development. According to Miyamoto, the Switch's development within Nintendo was headed by younger employees, with him saying \"it's really been them that have put this forward and designed this system\". Miyamoto said of the younger employees: \"I always look for designers who aren\u2019t super-passionate game fans. I make it a point to ensure they're not just a gamer, but that they have a lot of different interests and skill sets.\" Junior developers were also used to help brainstorm ideas of how to make sure the Switch had a longer lifecycle beyond the typical five-to-six years as most other consoles had. Miyamoto, Takeda, and Iwata were less involved, but provided necessary oversight on the Switch's development principally around the cost of implementing new features that would make the Switch stand out.  For Miyamoto, his limited involvement allowed him to spend more time on Nintendo's software titles being developed at the time, such as Super Mario Run.\n\nAnnouncements\nThe first public news of about the Switch's hardware happened alongside the announcement of Nintendo and DeNA's partnership on March 17, 2015. At this stage, Nintendo referred to the console under the codename \"NX\" and described it as a \"brand new concept\". At an investor's meeting in April 2016, Nintendo announced that it planned to release the NX worldwide in March 2017. While Nintendo did not unveil the NX's hardware at E3 2016 in June, it did announce that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which was originally announced as a Wii U-exclusive, would also be released for the NX. At a Nintendo shareholders' meeting following the conference, Miyamoto stated that the company had concerns that competitors could copy ideas from the NX if they revealed it too soon. The following month, rumors began to surface surrounding the nature of the console, including its use of Nvidia Tegra hardware, being a \"hybrid\" device intended for both home and mobile use, controllers that can detach from the main device and be played separately, and that Nintendo would distribute games on the console via cartridges and digital downloads.On October 20, 2016, Nintendo officially announced the console under the name Nintendo Switch, alongside a trailer that demonstrated the hardware's nature as a hybrid device. At the time of the trailer's release, Nintendo did not provide many details on features of the platform, though they planned to have events in 2017 to provide more details about the console. The company did state that there are additional features that were not presented in the introductory trailer. Miyamoto and Fils-Aim\u00e9 presented the Switch to host Jimmy Fallon on a broadcast of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in December 2016. In addition to showing more of the console's hardware and functionality, Fallon was given the opportunity to play part of Breath of the Wild live.Nintendo revealed technical details of the Switch, including its worldwide launch date and price, at a press event in Tokyo on January 13, 2017. The event was livestreamed, with an English voiceover provided by Nintendo of America through their broadcast and regional Twitter accounts relaying details in other languages. A Nintendo Treehouse event occurred the following day to reveal the full launch lineup and upcoming games for the Switch.\n\nRelease\nThe Switch was officially released on March 3, 2017, worldwide in Japan and most English-speaking and Western markets. It was released with an MSRP of \u00a529,980 in Japan, US$299.99 in the United States, GB\u00a3279.99 in the United Kingdom, and A$469.95 in Australia; with standardized pricing for the European market varying. The set includes a Switch console, a dock, left and right Joy-Con controllers and accompanying straps, a Joy-Con grip, an AC power adapter and an HDMI cable. There were two Switch bundles available at launch, one with grey Joy-Con and one with neon red and blue Joy-Con. Nintendo feared that a higher price would harm sales, which prompted them to not include any additional hardware or games. The global launch did not include parts of Asia, including India and Mainland China.\nThe Switch continued to be officially released in particular markets, such as Argentina on August 15, 2017, and in South Korea and Taiwan on December 1. In April 2018, CD Media, Nintendo's official distributor in Greece and the Balkans since 2016, announced after opening their new offices in Istanbul, that Nintendo's products will officially be distributed in Turkey later in the year. Nintendo abruptly withdrew from the Turkish market back in June 2012 when then-distributor Nortec Eurasia closed. CD Media released the Nintendo Switch in Turkey in July 2018. Nintendo's Singapore-based distributor, Maxsoft, officially launched the Nintendo Switch in the Philippines on November 30, 2018, in Thailand on March 29, 2019, and in Malaysia on January 17, 2020. In early-2019, Nintendo of Europe signed a partnership with Tel Aviv-based distributor TorGaming Ltd., making them Nintendo's official distributor in Israel, and launched their products in the market, including the Nintendo Switch, on March 1, 2019. Nintendo's Dubai-based distributor, Active Gulf, officially launched the Nintendo Switch in Oman on September 27, 2019.Although the Nintendo Switch had not officially been released in China prior to December 2019, it is still widely available in the country due to grey market imports from Hong Kong and other regions, such as Japan. In January 2018, former Nintendo president Tatsumi Kimishima said in an interview with Chinese news website QQ that Nintendo has tried to release the Switch in China, but has been unable to do so. Nintendo partnered with Tencent in April 2019 to gain the necessary approvals to release the Switch in China, along with a test version of New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe; it was released on December 10, 2019, at a base price of CN\u00a52,099 or about US$298. Tencent will continue to help Nintendo bring other Switch games through China's approval process via National Radio and Television Administration. In addition, Tencent will help localize various titles, and help implement the Nintendo Switch Online service within the country, integrating its offerings with the WeChat payment systems.Nintendo had exited the Brazilian market in 2015 due to high tariffs, but independent resellers have been trading the console in Brazil since March 2017. Nintendo had since assigned NC Games as their local game distributor in May 2017, and the local company had committed to sell some officially imported Nintendo Switch units in small quantities. NC Games silently went defunct in c. 2019. In August 2020, Nintendo affirmed that it would restart imports directly into Brazil, for release on September 18, 2020.By February 2021, about four years from the console's release, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa stated that \"The Switch is in the middle of its life cycle\".\n\nHardware\nThe Nintendo Switch is a hybrid video game console, consisting of a console unit, a dock, and two Joy-Con controllers. Although it is a hybrid console, Nintendo classifies it as \"a home console that you can take with you on the go\". Furthermore, the company has stated that the Switch and the Nintendo 3DS are meant to co-exist, considering the 3DS as an entry-level product for younger players.\n\nConsole\nThe main unit of the Switch is the console, a battery-powered tablet-like monitor that consists of an LCD screen measuring 6.2 inches (160 mm) on its diagonal, the same as the Wii U GamePad. The unit itself measures 173 by 102 by 13.9 millimetres (6.81 in \u00d7 4.02 in \u00d7 0.55 in) and weighs 297 grams (10.5 oz). The screen supports ten-point multi-touch capacitive sensing and includes haptic technology from Immersion Corporation. The LCD screen supports resolutions up to 720p (1280\u00d7720 px). The console includes a 3.5 mm audio jack, stereo speakers on the bottom face of the unit below the screen, a USB-C port for charging, and a kickstand on the back side. The unit also includes slots for a game card (cartridge-based media) and a microSD card slot located under the kickstand. The Switch console itself includes three buttons, all on the top of the device, Volume +/- and Power. The console has rails on the side, into which the Joy-Con controllers can be slid to attach them to the Switch unit. An ambient light sensor on the front of the console adjusts the screen's brightness automatically. The model number of the original Switch model is \"HAC-001\".There are three gameplay modes that can be used with the Switch; \"TV Mode\" with the console slid into the dock to support play on a television, \"Tabletop Mode\" with the console placed on a table or other flat surface using its kickstand for shared gaming away from a dedicated screen, or in \"Handheld Mode\" as a standard portable tablet device. Users can switch between these modes simply by placing the console in the dock or removing it, extending or retracting the kickstand, and detaching or connecting the Joy-Con. Games may be designed to play only in specific modes; for example, Voez initially could not be played in TV Mode and relied on touchscreen controls. Support for controllers and TV Mode was later added to Voez in January 2018 via an update for the game. Another example is Super Mario Party, which does not support Handheld Mode.Nintendo stated that the Switch is a \"single-screen experience\", in that the player either sees the content on the console when it is out of the dock, or on the screen attached to the dock when the console is docked. The Switch cannot feature dual-screen functionality that was offered through the Wii U via its GamePad.Nintendo patented a means of using multiple Switch consoles to create a multi-monitor configuration by arranging them on a flat surface and spanning a single gameplay environment across their screens. This technology was first seen in Super Mario Party.\n\nDock\nThe console, with or without Joy-Con attached, can be placed into the Switch dock, a docking station with electrical connectors to connect the console to a power supply to charge its battery, and to a television via an HDMI connection for video/audio output. The dock also includes two USB 2.0 ports and one USB 3.0 port. While docked, the unit can support resolutions up to 1080p and a maximum frame rate of 60 frames per second, though the maximum resolution varies depending on the game. As an example, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild runs at a maximum 900p and 30 frames per second while the Switch is docked. The dock measures 173 by 104 by 54 millimetres (6.8 in \u00d7 4.1 in \u00d7 2.1 in) and weighs 327 grams (11.5 oz).\n\nControllers\nJoy-Con\nThe Nintendo Switch comes with two controllers, collectively called Joy-Con and individually called the \"Joy-Con L\" and \"Joy-Con R\". The controllers attach to the Switch console via side rails using a locking mechanism, with a small release button on their rear face to allow them to be detached. When detached, they can be used as a pair by a single player, attached to a grip that emulates a gamepad form factor, or used as separate controllers by two individual players. A single Switch console can support up to eight Joy-Con connections. Straps can be attached to the sides of Joy-Con when they are detached. A charging grip is available for the Joy-Con, which provides a means to attach a USB-C cable for power. Alongside that, Nintendo released a charging strap that allows players to charge an individual Joy-Con via embedded AA batteries on June 16, 2017.\n\nPro Controller\nThe Switch also supports a wireless controller, called Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, which has a more traditional design reminiscent of the Wii Classic Controller Pro and Wii U Pro Controller. The Pro Controller connects to the Switch via wireless Bluetooth communication, and is charged through a standard USB-C port on the controller.\n\nOther\nThe Nintendo Switch supports a wide array of additional accessories, according to Kimishima. Kimishima suggested that the Switch is part of a large ecosystem of devices, though the Switch unit remains the core console element. Takahashi suggested the possibility of other units besides the Joy-Con that could attach and/or connect to the console to serve as alternate input devices and change how the Switch can be used.Nintendo offers a Joy-Con Wheel, a small steering wheel-like unit that a Joy-Con can slot into, allowing it to be used for racing games such as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Standalone docks are available, which include a power adapter and HDMI cable. Third parties also support the Switch with additional accessories, such as carrying cases and screen protectors. The 4.0.0 system update enabled support for GameCube controllers connected via USB with the GameCube adapter that was available for the Wii U as well as a new adapter produced for the Switch; GameCube controllers can be used with most games compatible with the Switch's Pro controller, such as Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. USB computer keyboards are supported for certain tasks, such as text entry.\n\nIn January 2018, Nintendo announced Nintendo Labo, a child-oriented platform that combines games coupled with do-it-yourself cardboard projects that attach or wrap around the Switch Console and Joy-Con, effectively creating toys around the Switch hardware to interact with games. These cardboard units, which may also include string, rubber bands, and other pieces, are referred to as Toy-Con. The game software provides instructions for the Toy-Con construction and provides the interface to control the Toy-Con. Such examples given include a remote-controlled \"car\", where the two Joy-Con attach to the car and their vibration feedback provide the motion for the car, controlled from the Switch, a fishing rod where the Joy-Con are part of the reel and handle of the rod and their motion controls used to simulate the act of fishing in the mini-game, and a small toy piano.In September 2018, with the release of Nintendo Switch Online, Nintendo introduced NES Controller style Joy-Con controllers alongside its classic games service. In September 2019, when SNES games were added to the service, wireless SNES Controllers were released. In September 2021, when Nintendo 64 games and Sega Genesis titles were added to the service alongside the Expansion Pack, wireless Nintendo 64 Controllers and SEGA Genesis Control Pads were released for use with their respective services.\nNintendo released Ring Fit Adventure in October 2019, which includes a Leg Strap to mount a Joy-Con to a leg, and the Ring-Con, a flexible hard plastic ring with Joy-Con mounting. The player interacts with the game, fashioned after a console role-playing game, by doing various exercises, such as running in place, squatting, and squeezing the ring, to perform in-game actions of running, jumping, and attacking and defending, respectively. Such features are part of Nintendo's \"quality of life\" goals to incorporate physical activity alongside the Switch, similar to past titles like Wii Fit.In February 2017, Nintendo president Tatsumi Kimishima stated that it had been \"studying\" virtual reality solutions, but felt that comfort was a main concern. Nintendo of America president and COO Reggie Fils-Aim\u00e9 also cited that existing VR solutions were not \"fun\" or \"social\". Nintendo ultimately unveiled a new Labo VR kit in March 2019, using a cardboard headset and viewer placed in front of the console's screen, in combination with attached accessories.Stands and alternate docks have also been created for the Switch to overcome the limitations of the device's own kickstand for tabletop play, including an official \"Adjustable Charging Stand\" that can be connected to the device's AC adapter.\n\nTechnical specifications\nSoC, CPU, GPU and RAM\nOriginal Switch models were released with model number \"HAC-001\". The Switch uses a system-on-chip from the Tegra family of products, developed in partnership with Nvidia. No specific details were revealed beyond that it is a \"custom\" Tegra chip \"based on the same architecture as the world's top-performing GeForce gaming graphics cards\" that are common in personal computers, and has a custom API known as \"NVN\", which is designed to \"bring lightweight, fast gaming to the masses\". Takeda described the Nvidia chipset as being critical for delivering gamers a level of performance similar to that which they experience on personal computers, helping to achieve \"high performance but low power consumption\" for the Switch. Pre-release reports, unconfirmed by either Nintendo or Nvidia, stated that the SoC would be a standard Nvidia Tegra X1 instead, composed of four ARM Cortex-A57 and four ARM Cortex-A53 CPU cores along with 256 Maxwell-based CUDA GPU cores. This was later corroborated by an analysis on the console done by Tech Insights in March 2017. The CPU cores are clocked at 1.020 GHz. While the SoC features 8 CPU cores, the Switch only uses the 4 Cortex-A57 cores, of which 1 is reserved to the operating system. The GPU cores are clocked at 768 MHz when the device is docked, and in handheld mode, fluctuating between the following speeds: 307.2 MHz, 384 MHz, and 460 MHz. This gives the Switch's GPU a theoretical peak performance of 393 GFLOPS in docked mode and 236 GFLOPS in handheld mode. A later iFixit teardown of the final product confirmed 4GB of LPDDR4. It's clocked at 1600 MHz in docked mode, while at a reduced 1331.2 MHz in handheld mode.\n\nWireless compatibility\nThe Switch offers Wi-Fi 5 (dual-band 802.11ac wireless connectivity compliant with 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac modes). Up to eight Switch consoles can be connected in a wireless ad hoc network for local multiplayer games, and multiple players can play on each of the connected Switch consoles. In the case of at least one game, Splatoon 2, ten Switch consoles can connect in the ad hoc network, though only eight can play directly while the other two can watch as spectators. The Switch uses Bluetooth 4.1 for wireless communication between the console and its controllers. Users can purchase a third-party USB LAN adapter for wired connectivity when the console is docked for TV mode. Nintendo's Wii LAN adapter accessory is also compatible with the Switch via USB ports on the Switch dock.\n\nPower/battery\nThe Switch is primarily powered in portable mode by a non-removable 4310 mAh, 3.7 V Lithium-ion rechargeable battery. The battery life is estimated to be between 2.5 and 6.5 hours, depending on the software being used. Nintendo gives the example of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild supporting approximately three hours of battery life. The battery can be charged either while in the dock, or through a standard USB-C connector on the console. The estimated recharge time while the unit is in sleep mode is about 3 hours. Nintendo offers the means for replacing batteries through its customer support. Each Joy-Con has its own non-removable 525 mAh, 3.7 V Lithium-ion battery separate from the console, with an estimated twenty-hour lifespan. These batteries are automatically charged if they are attached to the console while it is charging itself. Additional accessories have other means to charge the Joy-Con. While the basic Joy-Con grip that ships with the Switch does not offer charging capabilities, a separate premium Joy-Con grip includes a USB-C connector port that can be used to charge the Joy-Con batteries while they are connected to this grip.\n\nStorage\nThe Switch includes 32 GB of internal storage, 25.9 GB of which is user-accessible. This can be expanded up to 2 TB using a microSD, a microSDHC or a microSDXC card. A microSD card slot is located under the Switch's kickstand, where a microSD card can be inserted. If the microSD card is used, the Switch will only store game save data on the internal memory, leaving data that can be re-acquired on the microSD card. Save data will always be stored on the console, regardless if the source is a physical game card or a digital download copy. At launch, there was no way to transfer save files to another Switch console. Save game and profile transfers between Switch consoles were added in the 4.0.0 system update in October 2017, while the 10.0.0 system update in April 2020 allowed most update data, saved games (i.e., downloaded from eShop), and other downloaded content to be swapped between the internal memory and a microSD card. MicroSD and microSDHC were supported initially, and microSDXC card support was later added to the Switch's software via a system update. SD cards and miniSD cards do not fit the Switch. The Switch did not support external storage units at launch, but Nintendo stated that they were looking into adding this feature in the future.\n\nConnectivity\nThe Switch console has a 3.5 mm headphone jack. At launch, the Switch did not support Bluetooth wireless headphones, though they can also be connected if a Bluetooth adaptor is connected to the headphone jack. A system update in October 2017 partially resolved this issue by enabling support for wireless USB headphones when the receiver is connected to the USB port on the console when docked. This was later fully resolved in a system update in September 2021 when it enabled support for Bluetooth Wireless headphone devices without the need for a USB adapter.\n\nLater revisions\nAn updated version of the Nintendo Switch under model number \"HAC-001(-01)\" was announced on July 17, 2019, and was released in Japan and North America in mid-August 2019, and in the United Kingdom in September 2019. This revision uses the Tegra X1+ SoC, a more efficient chipset compared to the Tegra X1 used in the original model. Thus, the time-on-battery was effectively extended to 4.5\u20139 hours, depending on the game played. No other system component was updated in this revision.\n\nProduction\nThe Nintendo Switch is produced between Taiwan-based Foxconn and Japan-based Hosiden, with Foxconn accounting for the largest volume. Nintendo did not plan to sell the Switch below manufacturing cost at launch, as they had done for both the 3DS and Wii U at their respective launches; Nintendo affirmed that the Switch would be profitable from launch during its 2016 fiscal year earnings report, as the company saw the console as a key earnings driver for 2017 and beyond. Fomalhaut Techno Solutions, a Japanese product teardown firm, estimated that the Switch cost $257 to make compared to its $299 MSRP, with the console and dock at $167 while each Joy-Con costs $45. Kimishima said that they may be able to see further profitability on the Switch when they can achieve volume discounts on components once they reach a level of about 10 million Switch units.Prior to launch, Nintendo anticipated shipping two million Nintendo Switch units by the end of the console's first month, and assured that its supply chain would be able to meet demand following the launch period to avoid the shortage situation with the NES Classic Edition in late 2016. Kimishima anticipated that the Switch will have lifetime sales numbers similar to the Wii, which sold 101 million units by 2016.Following the initial sales report numbers in April 2017, the Financial Times reported that the company was seeking to produce 18 million Switch units in its 2017 financial year as to avoid \"customer tantrums\" with poor supply levels, particularly near the 2017 holiday season and the release of Super Mario Odyssey on October 27, 2017. Fils-Aim\u00e9 said in September 2017 that their 2017 production target for the Switch could be hampered by bottlenecks in individual components. DigiTimes reported in October 2017 that Nintendo had further shifted the production rate for the Switch up to 2 million per month, with plans to ship 20 million units by the end of the year; the newspaper also stated that the production rate was limited by component availability, and not by other factors of Nintendo's production process.On the presentation of the 2017 fiscal year results to investors, Nintendo's newly named president Shuntaro Furukawa stated that they anticipate producing 20 million Switch consoles over the 2018 fiscal year keeping the momentum of its sales in that year.In June 2019, The Wall Street Journal reported that Nintendo was starting to move some of its production of the Switch and two hardware revisions of the Switch outside of China and into Southeast Asia to limit the impact of new United States tariffs on electronics made in China.In November 2020, Bloomberg reported that Nintendo asked its assembly partners to boost production of the Switch by 20% and raised its target goal of Switch sales for the 2020 fiscal year from 25 million units sold to 30 million units, having previously reportedly raised their target for the fiscal year from 22 million units sold to 25 million units in August 2020. These boosts in production have been attributed to more demand mainly due to the success of Animal Crossing: New Horizons during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOther models\nNintendo Switch Lite\nOn July 10, 2019, Nintendo announced a version of the Nintendo Switch dedicated to handheld play called the Nintendo Switch Lite. The Switch Lite is a single unit, integrating the Joy-Con as part of the main unit's hardware, and uses a smaller screen measuring 5.5 inches (14 cm) diagonally. Additionally, a regular directional pad replaces the four directional buttons on the integrated left Joy-Con. While using a smaller battery than the original Switch, the Switch Lite uses a more power-efficient chipset, the 16-nanometer Tegra X1+, to extend the estimated use time from 2.5 to 6.5 hours to 3\u20137 hours on a single battery charge. Because of the integrated Joy-Con, the Switch Lite is primarily limited to those games that can be played in handheld mode, while some other games like 1-2-Switch require separate Joy-Con to be used.\nThe Switch Lite was released worldwide on September 20, 2019, with an MSRP of US$199.99.\n\nOLED model\nOn July 6, 2021, Nintendo officially announced a new model called the Nintendo Switch \u2013 OLED Model. The OLED model features a 7-inch (180 mm) 720p OLED display, and when docked, output to 1080p resolution. Additionally, it features 64 GB of internal storage, enhanced audio functions, and a wider adjustable stand for use in tabletop mode. The unit ships with a new dock that includes a wired LAN port. It features similar technical specifications as the base Switch model, and is compatible with all Switch games and existing accessories. The unit ships in two bundles: one that includes a black dock and red and blue Joy-Con (similar to the base model's default color scheme), and a white dock with white Joy-Con. It was released on October 8, 2021, alongside the release of Metroid Dread, with a retail price of $349.99.\nAhead of the release of the OLED version on September 13, 2021, Nintendo reduced the base price of the original Switch model in Europe from \u20ac329.99 to \u20ac299.99, and in the UK from GB\u00a3279.99 to GB\u00a3259.99, which Nintendo said also reflected changes in currency exchange rates. All other regions \u2013 including North America and Australia \u2013 did not receive a price cut.\n\nRumored high-end model\nIn early 2019, industry reports revealed that Nintendo had plans for two new models. One new model was a light-weight revision of the Switch, which turned out to be the Nintendo Switch Lite. The other new model, as reported by The Wall Street Journal and Nikkei, was to be a more powerful unit set to arrive in 2020. Potential revisions to the Switch were also observed by a notification Nintendo had sent to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) alerting the FCC to changes in the Switch's system-on-a-chip and NAND memory from its original design in July 2019. DigiTimes corroborated reports of a new hardware version of the Switch, stating Nintendo planned to release a new version with an improved CPU and magnesium alloy body in the second half of 2020. In its financial statement for the quarter ending December 31, 2019, Nintendo stated there were no plans for new Switch consoles through 2020, and instead their priority was to help better communicate the advantages of the Switch Lite over the Switch to boost its sales.During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a global chip shortage that persisted into 2021, which did impact the rate of Switch production. Both Bloomberg News and Economic Daily News from Taiwan continued to state that Nintendo was preparing to release a higher-end model, based on their discussions with Nintendo's manufacturing and supply chain partners. These reports indicated the new model would be based on newer OLED screen technology, support 4K resolution and faster processors, and would likely start production in mid-2021 as to ship near the end of 2021. With this timing, it had been expected for Nintendo to announce the model at E3 2021 in June that year, but Nintendo did not do so, instead revealing the OLED revision of the base Switch model in the months that followed. Nintendo of America CEO Doug Bowser said, in light of these rumors, they would announce new hardware when they felt the time was right, and that \"We are always looking at technology and how technology can enhance gameplay experiences. It's not technology for technology's sake.\"Bloomberg News continued to state that a higher-end revision of the Switch was in the works, reporting in September 2021 that development kits for this new model had been received by several developers they had spoken to. According to Bloomberg News and their sources, Nintendo had planned to release the high end model sometime in 2020 or 2021, and had secured the supply of OLED screens in anticipation of this, but with the global chip shortage, the supply of chips was not there. Bloomberg claimed that Nintendo pivoted on the high-end design and instead redesigned the base Switch model to use the OLED screens instead, holding off plans for the high-end Switch model release until at least 2022 after chip supplies had become more stable. Nintendo immediately denied these reports, stating that the report was \"not true\" and \"falsely claims that Nintendo is supplying tools to drive game development for a Nintendo Switch with 4K support\", and that the company has \"no plans for launching any other model at this time\". Zynga, one of the companies specifically named in Bloomberg's report, also denied they had received such a kit.Continued rumors of a high-end Switch model were fueled from leaked publication of Nvidia's proprietary source code in February 2022, showing support for a custom Nvidia chip for Nintendo with DLSS support.\n\nBundles and cross-promotional models\n2017\nA Splatoon 2\u2013themed bundle was released in Europe on July 21, 2017, and in Japan; additionally, a separate bundle that included \"neon\" green and pink Joy-Con (matching the color schemes from Splatoon 2) was offered in Japan. The bundle was released in North America as a Walmart exclusive on September 8, 2017. A Monster Hunter XX pack-in bundle was released in August 2017 in Japan, with themed decals on the console and dock. A Super Mario Odyssey pack-in bundle was released alongside the game on October 27, 2017, which includes red Joy-Con and a themed carrying case.\n\n2018\nIn May 2018, the \"2nd Unit Set\" was released in Japan, exclusively on the My Nintendo Store at a reduced price of \u00a524,980. The bundle was positioned towards households which already owned a Switch and, as such, it did not include a dock, AC adapter, HDMI cable, and Joy-Con grip. A Mario Tennis Aces and 1-2-Switch pack-in bundle with neon red and blue Joy-Con was released in North America on September 5, exclusively at Walmart. A Fortnite bundle with red and blue Joy-Con which included Fortnite Battle Royale exclusive items and in-game currency was released in North America on October 5 and in Japan on November 22. A Minecraft pack-in bundle with gray Joy-Con and Minecraft stickers was released in Japan on November 30. A Diablo III: Eternal Collection pack-in bundle with themed decals on the dock, console and a carrying case was released on November 2 in Europe and in the United States exclusively at GameStop. A Super Smash Bros. Ultimate-themed bundle, including a branded Dock and Joy-Con, was released the same day, which includes a download code for the game. A Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and a Let's Go, Eevee!-themed bundles were released worldwide on their games' launch day on November 16. They included a console with Pikachu and Eevee decals on the back, a dock with a decal of both on the front, a right and left Joy-Con and their straps based on the color scheme of each Pok\u00e9mon respectively, a preinstalled version of the game, and a Pok\u00e9 Ball Plus peripheral. A Mario Kart 8 Deluxe red and blue Joy-Con pack-in bundle was released in North America on November 23 Black Friday.\n\n2019\nA red and blue Joy-Con bundle with US$35 Nintendo eShop credit was released on February 15, 2019. A pink and purple Joy-Con Disney Tsum-Tsum Festival bundle was released in Japan on October 10. Both the Switch dock and Joy-Con are decorated with characters from Tsum-Tsum.\n\n2020\nAn Animal Crossing: New Horizons-themed bundle was released on March 13, 2020. A Fortnite special edition was released in Europe on October 30, 2020, and in Australia and New Zealand on November 6.\n\n2021\nA Mario Red & Blue Edition-themed bundle was released on January 12, 2021. A special Monster Hunter Rise bundle was released alongside the game on March 26, 2021.\n\nSoftware\nThe Nintendo Switch runs on a custom-made operating system named Horizon, built on a microkernel architecture. The Switch's user interface features tile-based access to games that are either present in the game card slot or stored within the unit's storage devices. It includes quick access buttons for a News feed from Nintendo, eShop access, and a photo album for screenshots captured during gameplay; the 4.0 update to the software in October 2017 also enabled capturing and sharing video from select games. A single Switch console supports up to eight user profiles, which each can be tied to a Nintendo Account user ID. Profiles can be represented by either a pre-made avatar from an internal gallery, or using a Mii. The Mii creator was upgraded with increased color options for aspects such as hair styles; however, it is integrated into the system settings, rather than being an independent application.Prior to the 4.0 update, players discovered that the Switch's firmware included an Easter egg allowing players to play the NES Golf title via a built-in emulator. While Nintendo has not confirmed its presence, journalists and players believed this to be a tribute to Nintendo's former president Satoru Iwata; Golf was programmed by Iwata, and the game could only be accessed if the system clock was set to July 11 \u2013 the day when Iwata died in 2015 \u2013 and the Joy-Con are moved similarly to how Iwata would move his hands in his Nintendo Direct presentations. Some Japanese users referred to this as an omamori (charm) left by Iwata himself. With the 4.0 update, the executable code for this Easter egg appears to have been wiped by Nintendo.In August 2018, a Twitter user found files on the Switch's firmware while reverse-engineering the console, which suggested that Nintendo was possibly testing VR functionality for the Switch. The Twitter user was able to activate the hidden \"VR Mode\", which split the screen into two displays. Hackers found that the code related to possible VR functionality had been hidden in the Switch firmware for over a year.\n\nSecurity\nNintendo continued its white hat security program that it had with the Nintendo 3DS. With help of third-party website HackerOne, Nintendo will award up to $20,000 to the first user to identify any vulnerability that impacts piracy, cheating, or potential sending of inappropriate content to younger users, the amount based on the severity of the security flaw.In April 2018, two separate groups discovered a method to use an exploit chain in the Tegra chip system that can be used to boot other software on the Switch.  The exploit could not be patched through a software update, as the BootROM of the Tegra X1 can not be modified after the chip leaves the factory. Both groups had notified Nvidia and Nintendo of the exploit before publicly announcing their findings. Users studying the hardware determined that Nintendo has the capacity to permanently ban specific Switch consoles used to obtain software via this exploit from the Nintendo Network, as the Switch console includes a unique device identification code used as part of the validation to the Network. As games downloaded from the Nintendo Network include encrypted information that ties the Nintendo ID to the console, which is transmitted to Nintendo when users start playing games, Nintendo can track unapproved software downloads and take action. Nintendo has reportedly fixed the vulnerability in newer Switch units as of July 2018.In June 2018, two hackers found a way to run the Switch system's developer software menu on non-developer Switch units, allowing users to directly load games onto SD cards or create custom avatars for their user profile, including pornographic and NSFW pictures, which violate Nintendo's terms of service. A Nintendo spokesperson responded to Kotaku's article on the topic, saying that \"Modified Nintendo Switch systems have been banned\".Shortly after the release of Nintendo Switch Online in September 2018, hackers and modders were able to figure out how to run unauthorized ROMs on the Nintendo Switch NES emulator. A Switch hacker who goes by the name DevRin, was the first to discover the hack and posted his findings on YouTube, which prompted a modder who goes by the name KapuccinoHeck to investigate the matter with two others and their findings were later posted on KapuccinoHeck's Twitter account.\n\nOnline services\nNintendo Switch user profiles can be linked to a Nintendo Account, which enables access to online features and the ability to download and purchase software from Nintendo eShop. A Nintendo Account can be created with an account from a third-party social networking service or an existing Nintendo Network ID from a 3DS or Wii U. Nintendo does not plan to offer first-party social networking services on Switch, such as Miiverse or StreetPass, the latter owing to Nintendo's promotion of Switch as primarily being a home console. Instead, profiles can be linked to existing social networks such as Facebook and Twitter for social and sharing features.Players can register friends through Friend Codes as with previous Nintendo systems, searching for friends in the local network, through past multiplayer interactions, or through Nintendo Account profiles registered as friends on Nintendo mobile apps such as Miitomo and Super Mario Run. In March 2017, Nintendo said that they had plans to provide other methods for registering friends, including through third-party social media and via Nintendo Network IDs. Support for registering friends on the Switch via Facebook and Twitter was added on March 13, 2018, as part of the 5.0.0 system update. The Switch has no native support for Nintendo Network IDs, but users can link their Nintendo Network ID credentials to a Nintendo Account profile, which enables the ability to add friends that they had already registered on their 3DS or Wii U, and share an eShop balance between all three platforms.In line with Microsoft and Sony consoles, a subscription is required to access online multiplayer in most games. The Nintendo Switch Online subscription includes access to online play, voice chat, access to an ongoing library of Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) games, cloud storage for save data on most games, as well as other special offers and promotions. A paid expansion pack released in October 2021 added support for an expanding library of Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis games. Free-to-play games such as Fortnite Battle Royale and Warframe are exempt from the subscription requirement for online play.The Nintendo Switch Online mobile app allows access to voice chat for Switch Online subscribers, as well as access to game-specific microsites. Unlike its competitors, voice chat is not supported via the console itself, requiring use of the app on a smartphone instead. A separate app provides access to parental controls for the console.\n\nMedia support\nThe Switch did not launch with any multimedia-oriented features, such as a web browser, a messaging system or support for video streaming services. Fils-Aim\u00e9 said that because the Switch is geared as a gaming console that is far different from what their competitors offer, they had focused on achieving that goal first and foremost, and did not see media support as a differentiator from their competitors.Niconico, a popular Japanese video service, launched for the Switch in Japan on July 13, 2017, and was the Switch's first third-party media app in any market. Hulu was the first video streaming application released for the Switch in the United States on November 9, 2017. A YouTube application was released on November 8, 2018. Fils-Aim\u00e9 said in June 2018 that conversations to bring Netflix to the Switch were \"on-going\". On November 4, 2020, a trial version app of the Tencent Video streaming service was launched exclusively for Nintendo Switch consoles officially distributed by Tencent in mainland China. An official version app will be launched at a later date. Funimation launched their own streaming app for the Nintendo Switch, featuring a reworked layout and new functions. The app became available via eShop in the United States and Canada on December 15, 2020, and will launch in various other countries at a later date, such as the United Kingdom and Ireland on March 22, 2021. A version of the Twitch app launched for the Nintendo Switch on November 11, 2021 in most regions worldwide. The eShop version of the app allows users to watch or follow any live or recorded content on Twitch, but does not support any native ability for Switch players to contribute content.Korg Gadget, a music production app, was released for the Nintendo Switch on April 26, 2018. InkyPen, a comics and manga subscription app, launched exclusively on the Switch worldwide on December 17, 2018. Izneo, another comics and manga subscription service, was released for the Switch on February 28, 2019. FUZE4, a text-based programming language app, was released in August 2019.\n\nGames\nDistribution\nGames for the Nintendo Switch can be obtained through either retail channels or digitally through the Nintendo eShop. Games distributed at retail are stored on proprietary cartridges, similar in design to the game cards used for Nintendo 3DS games, albeit smaller and thinner. As the world's first major hybrid console, the console is the first major home-playable video game system to make use of cartridges since the Nintendo 64. Due to their small size at 31 by 21 by 3 millimetres (1.22 in \u00d7 0.83 in \u00d7 0.12 in), Nintendo coats each cartridge with denatonium benzoate, a non-toxic bitterant used to discourage children from ingesting them. Nintendo offered a suggested retail price for Switch games at the console's launch of US$60, equivalent to the price for new games on either the Xbox One and PlayStation 4. Nintendo otherwise allows publishers to set the price for a game, only requiring the list price be the same for physical and digital releases, if a physical release is made. This has caused some games also available on other consoles to be priced higher on the Switch due to the costs of manufacturing the game card for the Switch version. Online media outlets have colloquially referred to this price hike as the \"Switch tax\". The \"Switch tax\" also applies to many games that had been previously released on other platforms ported later to the Switch, where the Switch game price reflects the original price of the game when it was first released rather than its current price. It is estimated that the cost of Switch games is an average of 10% over other formats.Game cards at the time of the Switch's release had a 32GB capacity; Nintendo had planned to introduce 64GB game cards by the second half of 2018, but had to push this back. Some physical games may still require content to be installed to internal storage, with some games using a significant portion of the internal memory if a microSD card is not available. Other physical games which have a large amount of content may require a microSD card to be present in the Switch, such as NBA 2K18; such games are clearly marked on the cover to show these requirements.The Switch supports the ability for cloud gaming to run games that require more hardware capabilities than the Switch allows, running these games over a network with the game computations performed on server hardware. These games may be tied to specific regions due to purchasing options. Early examples of such games on the Switch include Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, Phantasy Star Online 2 and Assassin's Creed: Odyssey which were primarily limited to Japanese releases, while more recently Control and Hitman 3 will be offered through cloud gaming worldwide in 2020 and beyond.Unlike previous Nintendo home consoles, the Switch is region-free. This allows players to use cartridges or downloaded content from any part of the world, with the exception of Chinese game content which can only be played on Switch units manufactured for that country. Nintendo recommends using the appropriate regional eShop for digital purposes for obtaining the best post-purchase support if needed. Nintendo opted to go region-free to reduce the amount of workload and cost to both themselves and developers in having to manage two or more regional certification processes and different ROM cartridge production pathways for those regions. Further, eShop purchases, while still tied to the Nintendo Account, are not tied to the specific Switch console, as was the case for previous Nintendo hardware. Once the user re-registers their account to a Switch, they have access to download all previous purchases; however, a user can only have their account registered on one console at a time, and downloaded software tied to an account cannot be used if that account is not registered to the device. With the console's 6.0.0 system update, alongside the launch of the Online service in September 2018, a user can play games that they have purchased from the eShop on a second Switch console, though requiring continuous online connection and other restrictions.The Switch does not use optical discs, and does not have native backward compatibility with software from any previous Nintendo console. The Switch is also not backwards compatible with other digital titles from previous consoles.Emulated versions of games from previous Nintendo systems are offered through eShop and the Nintendo Switch Online service, although the blanket Virtual Console brand used for these releases on Wii, Wii U, and 3DS has been dropped. In February 2017, Kimishima said that the Switch is powerful enough to emulate titles from previous Nintendo consoles.\n\nThird-party support\nOne of the generally perceived failures of the Wii U was a lack of support from third-party developers, leading to a weak library of games. Nintendo was more aggressive in trying to bring on third-party developers, early in the Switch's development, to ensure a stronger lineup of games. Takahashi and Koizumi reached out to many of the third-parties directly to help gain their support early on. Electronic Arts' executive Patrick S\u00f6derlund said that Nintendo had taken a different track with attracting third-party developers to the Switch and have engaged Electronic Arts and other major developers throughout the development of the Switch, listening to their input, to help make the Switch more successful.Nintendo also began gaining support of independent video game developers in the middle of 2016 to provide assistance to help them bring games to the Switch, led by Nintendo's head of partner management Damon Baker. They had tried to draw in indie developers near the end of the Wii U's lifetime, providing indie game demos that were highlighted during E3 2015, but by this point, the Wii U had already been considered a failure. Nintendo sees games such as Snipperclips as a model of their target for indie games, in which they worked to help provide Switch implementation support and software tools to these parties early in the console's lifecycle, according to Takahashi and Koizumi. Some, like Yacht Club Games, who have ported Shovel Knight to the Switch, noted that some of the major innovations in the Switch, such as the Joy-Con, were not revealed to them until just prior to the January 2017 announcement. Nintendo of America reached out to many independent developers and publishers, including Chucklefish, Team17, and Devolver Digital, to gain titles for the platform and make the process of publishing easier. Nintendo still curates which titles they allow on the system, using the company's past portfolio for evaluation, and still carefully time releases to keep a steady stream of new content. However, once a game is greenlit, pushing out patches and updates can be done rapidly and at no further cost to the developer. Nintendo also offers the Switch's dev kit at 50,000 yen, or about $450, far under the cost of a comparable dev kit for other consoles, making it more amenable for smaller developers to afford and build for the unit. Nintendo offers several of these indie games as \"Nindies\" through the eShop. Nintendo had anticipated that they would have at least sixty indie games released for the Switch through 2017, but ended up with over 320 titles by the end of 2017 as a result of the console's popularity. Indie developers have found that Nintendo has also had a significant role in the promotion and marketing of their games, including using the games to help promote the Switch itself, in contrast to Microsoft or Sony. These developers also found Nintendo tries to keep a better rapport with fans of Nintendo's products, and help these fans identify Switch indie games they feel they will like the most, including those games that build on Nintendo's classic games from the NES, SNES, and Game Boy eras that can draw in a more global audience. Baker says that while they do try to encourage indie developers to release their games as a Switch console exclusive, they do not force developers towards this, knowing that the developers must have a good business case for doing so.While many independent developers have praised Nintendo for better support for the Switch, others, speaking anonymously through Nintendo Life, noted that Nintendo seemed to have a \"walled garden\" approach with independent developers, a remnant from the WiiWare program that allowed a great deal of shovelware to be pushed onto it. These anonymous developers found that Nintendo was either eschewing some developers completely, or requiring them to have a well-known publishing partner or an inside person within Nintendo to be able to gain the rights to publish for the Switch. Baker said that they encourage self-publishing, but do also place value on trust of established partners for their recommendations of what games would be best for the Switch. Another factor limiting Nintendo is the availability of dev kits and other hardware at the start of the console's life. However, Baker does anticipate that Nintendo will be much more open in the future, once they have addressed the necessary issues for curation and discovery of titles via the eShop.During its official unveiling in October 2016, Nintendo deliberately opted not to provide a list of games for the system, as they \"want people to touch the device in January [2017] and experience the software for themselves\", according to Kimishima. Instead, Nintendo announced some of the partners that had committed to supporting the Switch; contrasting Nintendo's struggles to gain third-party support on-launch for previous platforms, the company initially listed 48 third-party publishers, studios, and middleware developers. Among these partners, Nintendo listed major publishers such as Activision, Bethesda, Electronic Arts, Sega, Square Enix, Take-Two, and Ubisoft.Nintendo had previously relied more on providing its own internally developed tools and libraries that third-party developers would use to develop games for earlier systems. With the Switch, the company went a different route. According to Takahashi, \"we have been aiming to realize an environment in which a variety of different third-party developers are able to easily develop compatible software\", taking advantage of the Nvidia chipset's support for many standard libraries that allows for ease of transition from other platforms to the Switch. Unity Technologies, Epic Games, and the Khronos Group pledged support to help developers bring games to the Switch using their game engines and middleware, Unity, Unreal Engine 4, and the Vulkan and OpenGL graphical APIs, respectively; for instance, the Unreal Engine toolkit was updated in February 2017 to provide beta testing for native support for Switch games, with full support added by May 2017. In March 2018, Nintendo announced it had also gained support of YoYo Games' GameMaker Studio 2 engine for the Switch. Miyamoto said that Nintendo's own developers have \"mastered\" engines like Unreal, so that while it would be unlikely that Nintendo would release a first-party title using such software, they can help support developers using these tools on the Switch. Several indie developers who have previously worked on Nintendo's consoles said that the Switch was \"the least demanding Nintendo console\" they have developed for.In addition to these third-party middleware solutions, Nintendo developed its own NintendoWare Bezel Engine for first- and third-party developers, first announced in 2018, aimed \"to provide an environment that can create interesting games in a short period of time while keeping development costs as low as possible\". Games like Tetris 99 and Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics were developed in this engine.\n\nLibrary\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, originally announced as a Wii U exclusive, was released for the Switch as a launch title. The console's reveal trailer showcased footage from new titles in Nintendo franchises, including Super Mario Odyssey, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and Splatoon 2, as well as footage from NBA 2K18 and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Although Nintendo and third-parties stated at that time that these were not necessarily representative of Switch titles, all five titles were confirmed as Switch releases during the January 2017 press events.The Switch did not launch with any bundled games or have any pre-loaded games or game demos; Fils-Aim\u00e9 stated that once they had decided on the price point and evaluated the forthcoming game lineup, they opted to allow consumers to choose which games to get rather than include one in the bundle and increase its price. At least ten games were shipped or digitally available alongside the Switch in time for its North American launch, including Nintendo's first-party titles The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and 1-2-Switch.\nFils-Aim\u00e9 said that Nintendo planned a \"steady cadence of content\" for the Switch after launch, avoiding the perceived situation with gaps between major releases for Wii U software. Kimishima said that Nintendo scheduled its first-party releases \"to continue to provide new titles regularly without long gaps\", as this \"encourages consumers to continue actively playing the system, maintains buzz, and spurs continued sales momentum for Nintendo Switch.\" Journalists noted that Nintendo appeared to be pledged to this approach following their schedule of planned releases of first-party games for the Switch as announced during E3 2017, with a new title roughly every month into early 2018.\n\nMarketing\nA key part of marketing the Switch was to be \"crystal clear in our communication of what the product was and what the product could do\", according to Fils-Aim\u00e9, so as to avoid similar issues with how they presented the Wii U. While the Wii U was designed as a home console unit, Nintendo's lack of clarity on this point led to a general assumption that the unit, principally the Wii U GamePad, was more like a tablet, overshadowing the Wii U's other features (such as dual-screen play modes). Nintendo also believed that some consumers had mistaken the Wii U GamePad as being an accessory for the existing Wii console, rather than being the flagship feature of an entirely new platform. Instead, for the Switch, Fils-Aim\u00e9 said the company was \"very aggressive and clearly communicating the proposition that it's a home console you can take on the go wherever and whenever you want\".For example, the October 2016 trailer (considered significantly unlike Nintendo's past marketing efforts, according to Bloomberg) was designed to show the various ways that the Switch can be used so that viewers would recognize that \"each of its forms offer different play experiences for people to enjoy\". Kimishima said that the intent of the trailer was to show that the device was aimed across all player demographics, showcasing features that core gamers would recognize and appreciate to carry this intent. A large amount of Nintendo's launch marketing for the console focused heavily on the launch title Breath of the Wild; Nintendo of America marketing executive, Nick Chavez, stated that the decision to showcase the new Zelda game was meant to promote it to both older viewers, who may have grown up with the franchise's earliest games and are accustomed to modern open world games, and to a new generation of players.Nintendo aired its first-ever Super Bowl ad during the United States broadcast of Super Bowl LI. Set to the Imagine Dragons song \"Believer\", the ad showcased the various play modes with the Switch and its launch titles, particularly Breath of the Wild, and upcoming releases; while an ad to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Pok\u00e9mon was broadcast the previous year during Super Bowl 50, this ad was paid for by The Pok\u00e9mon Company and not by Nintendo. Chavez said of the ad, \"There's no bigger stage in the U.S. on which to showcase the platform. I think it speaks to our confidence in the system.\"Additional television commercials followed the Super Bowl spot, which were to demonstrate Switch's use cases among different demographics, as well as \"casual\" and \"core\" gaming audiences. Such ad venues included the 2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, the 2017 Kids' Choice Awards, and on programming blocks for Nickelodeon, Adult Swim, and Comedy Central. Chavez emphasized that Nintendo's overall marketing for Switch was not be \"just a six to eight week launch campaign\", but \"really a 15 month campaign for us, to say nothing of our plans for 2018\".\n\nIn addition to advertising, Nintendo had planned several ways for players to try the system before its release through various \"sampling events\". Kimishima felt that it was important, particularly for \"career gamers\", for Nintendo to get the Switch into players' hands, so that players could understand how the system differs from Nintendo's previous offerings. Kimishima also said that the company was \"running a guerrilla marketing program where we're just dashing around and trying to have as many events as possible and get it in the hands of players so they can experience the difference.\"The North American and European press had special events on January 13, 2017, following the Tokyo presentation. Various Switch demonstration events were run in North America, Europe, and Japan during January and February 2017. Nintendo offered demonstrations of the Switch at gaming conferences including PAX South, South by Southwest, and RTX. Nintendo also promoted the Switch through an \"Unexpected Places\" campaign in February 2017, temporarily setting up living-room-style spaces in three United States locations and inviting fans and players, including John Cena, to try out the unit.In June 2018, Nintendo announced it was partnering with Disney Channel to help produce Nintendo Switch Family Showdown, a televised competition where families competed in challenges around various Switch games in August 2018.\n\nReception\nPre-release\nMarket analysts had a mixed response to the October 2016 announcement of the Nintendo Switch. Some expressed concern that the Switch failed to address the issues that led to poor Wii U sales, and was aimed at a small audience. Others were more upbeat, believing the Switch approach would fit in well in the Japanese market, where space for dedicated consoles and televisions are limited, and transition into Western ones. Taylor also approved of the company's decision to introduce the console prior to the holiday season, when Microsoft and Sony would attempt to attract casual gamers to their consoles.Following the January 2017 press conference revealing the unit's pricing and release date, journalists expressed concern at the apparently high system price, comparable to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles but lacking some of their capabilities, the cost of the paid-for Nintendo Switch Online service, and the small number of games that were confirmed for launch. However, other analysts found that the pricing factors indicated the Switch was a more robust console, and would likely sell better than the Wii U, with The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild being a key sales driver. These analysts also figured the Switch fills an appropriate gap in hardware for those seeking more complex gameplay that is not offered in tablet and mobile gaming but who did not need to purchase a powerful \"boxy\" console. Most analysts agreed that the success of the Switch depends on Nintendo's support and avoiding mistakes the company had made in marketing and promoting the Wii U.Nintendo investors showed wariness at the Switch, as its stock price dropped in the months from the system's announcement up until its release. Analysts believed investors felt the Switch was very risky and were unsure if the unit would draw new audiences to Nintendo. Analysis firms estimated the Switch would have a slow start due to the risk of the system and high price, but could still clear up to 40 million units by 2020.Game and hardware developers were more positive towards the Switch, seeing the system as \"a more unifying experience between their handheld and console divisions\", but expressed concern on unanswered hardware specifications, and how Nintendo would market the unit to draw in developers. Developer Hideo Kojima compared the notion of the Switch to his idea of \"transfarring\" that he presented in 2011, allowing players to take a game from a home platform to a portable one, which became the basis of Sony's cross-buy program. He said that the Switch was \"an extension of that idea. The fact you can play something at home and take it outside, this is the gamer's dream. The Switch is an evolution of that.\" Bethesda's Todd Howard stated, \"I think Nintendo is the only company that could pull something like this off,\" commenting on the Nintendo Switch's design and functionality. Phil Spencer, head of Microsoft's Xbox division, said he was impressed with Nintendo's ability to \"state a bold vision and build a product that delivers on that vision\".Retailers were also generally positive with the Switch; GameStop CEO Paul Reines stated the unit was transformative in the market and would be a \"game-changer\" that could \"expand the audience for gaming\". Pre-orders were high, with Kimishima stating before launch that total pre-orders reached nearly the levels of units they had ready to ship for launch.The October 2016 reveal trailer became Nintendo of America's most-viewed video on YouTube within 24 hours, and was the top trending video on YouTube for about a day.\n\nRelease\nUpon release, the Switch was praised by reviewers for having a lot of potential, but they were underwhelmed by the limited number of titles available at launch that did not show the full extent of the console's abilities. Reviewers also noted that the initial operating software and features were limited and included software bugs that, while likely to be fixed in time, marred the experience of the system. Even with the day-one update, there were numerous reports of hardware problems, in particular the Bluetooth connectivity of the Switch console with the Joy-Con L controller, and ease with which the console screen could be scratched. About a week after release, Fils-Aim\u00e9 said the company is in \"fact-finding mode\" to try to diagnose these issues. In late March, Nintendo reported that the Joy-Con L desync issue was a \"manufacturing variation\" on a small number of the units, which could be easily fixed; as noted by CNET's Sean Hollister, Nintendo repaired affected controllers by placing a bit of foam near the antenna within the unit to better shield it. Going forward, Nintendo said they do not anticipate any other problems with connectivity issues. Many users also reported issues with defective pixels on the LCD screen of the console, which Nintendo has stated \"are normal and should not be considered a defect\". Other companies in the video game industry such as Sony, Microsoft, Sega, Bethesda, Ubisoft and Unity Technologies congratulated Nintendo on the Switch, along with fast food companies such as Arby's and Domino's Pizza, which made a practice of posting game-inspired artworks on social media.About six months after release, Nintendo reported their usage statistics for the Switch. Using statistics collected by the system for the primary player on the console, they found that 30% of users operate the console in Handheld/Tabletop mode more than 80% of the time, slightly more than 50% of users operate the console in both TV mode and Handheld/Tabletop mode equally, with the remaining users preferring TV mode. Nintendo stated \"We can clearly see that consumers are playing to suit their own play styles.\" Nintendo also found that the majority of people who purchased the Switch in the United States are male consumers in their 20s and early 30s.Following the implementation of firmware version 5.0.0, several Switch users began reporting that their consoles became unusable after having been docked within a third-party \"portable\" dock manufactured by Nyko. Nyko commented on the issue, stating that they were aware of the issue and thought it to be caused by the Switch's handling of A/V output, while Nintendo advised users against docking their systems inside unlicensed docking peripherals. After purchasing the dock at a Walmart store in Jacksonville, Florida, and losing usability of his console upon using the dock, Switch owner Michael Skiathitis filed a class action lawsuit against Nyko, alleging the dock to be \"prone to causing numerous problems to the devices they are intended to support\" against the knowledge of purchasers, as well as noting that Nyko had not put much effort into warning consumers about the issue. Other Switch owners reported having their consoles bricked upon using various other third-party docks, including models made by FastSnail and Insignia.\n\nSales\nInitial launch\nInitial sales of the Switch were strong, with Nintendo reporting that based on its first week's numbers, it was the company's fastest-selling console. In Japan, first weekend sales exceeded 330,000 units, which was on par with the PlayStation 4 during its launch period. Sales during this initial period were strong in the United States, United Kingdom, France, and Germany. Media Create estimated that more than 500,000 Switch units were sold in Japan within its first month, beating out the PlayStation 4 to this figure.Nintendo issued the Switch's first month's performance in their 2016 fiscal year results (which ended March 31, 2017), reporting that more than 2.74 million units had been sold worldwide, exceeding their target of two million. Retailer GameStop reported that initial sales of the Switch were \"phenomenal\" and on track to surpass the Wii U based on their historical sales data, with merchandising director Eric Bright saying the Switch has had \"one of the highest attach rates of software and accessories to a device that we've seen in a long time\". Retailer GameStop reported significant growth in hardware sales in its first quarter of 2017 due primarily to the Switch, while Best Buy saw an unexpected increase in their hardware sales in its first quarter of 2017 buoyed by the popularity of the Switch. Console sales in Japan, which had been languishing due to the strength of the mobile game market, saw its first annual growth of 14.8% in 2017 due to the release of the Switch. Physical sales for Switch games were at 5.46 million worldwide in its first month, with 2.76 million copies of Breath of the Wild for the Switch making up nearly half of those sales. On Breath of the Wild's nearly 1-to-1 sales with the Switch console, Nintendo's Kimishima said, \"This high of an attach rate is more or less unprecedented\".The large sales within the first month forced Nintendo to increase their production capacity, and to temporarily use air freight to ship Switch units instead of their usual overseas shipment, costing an estimated $45 per console, rather than the less-costly overseas shipment. With these changes, Nintendo projected that it would sell at least 10 million Switch consoles during the 2017 fiscal year, alongside 35 million games. Kimishima stated that having a Switch user base of 10 million \"will give publishers and the rest of our business partners a sense that the future of Nintendo Switch is more promising\" and spur further game development for the platform. Kimishima said that a key goal in their production ramp up would be to make sure they have enough Switch inventory near the end of 2017 for holiday sales, as to avoid the issue with Wii shortages that occurred during its first holiday-season period, while balancing the near-term high demand. According to Kimishima, Nintendo now believed that if they could reach 10 million in Switch sales in 2017, they expected the Switch would have lifetime sales comparable to the Wii, which had sold over 100 million units in its lifetime.The Switch continued to show strong sales throughout its first year of release. In its financial report released in October 2017 for the quarter ending September 30, 2017, Nintendo reported worldwide sales of the Switch at 7.63 million, with the expectation to sell more than 14 million by the end of its current financial year, exceeding the Wii U's lifetime 13.56 million sales. Five software titles had achieved at least one million in sales by this point: Breath of the Wild (4.7M), Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (4.42M), Splatoon 2 (3.61M), 1-2 Switch (1.37M), and Arms (1.35M). Shortly after this financial report, Nintendo reported that Super Mario Odyssey for the Switch sold more than two million copies within three days of its release on October 27, 2017. Following this financial report, the Wall Street Journal asserted that Nintendo anticipated to continue ramping production of the Switch in its 2018 fiscal year, with plans to produce between 25 and 30 million units that year or more depending on the 2017 holiday sales. During the November 2017 Black Friday, Small Business Saturday, and Cyber Monday sales that kicked off the holiday shopping season in North America, Adobe Digital Insights' analysis showed the Switch was one of the top-five selling items, outpacing the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One. NPD Group adjusted their future performance of the Switch to follow more closely with the Wii's lifetime sales rather than the Wii U's.On December 12, 2017, the company announced the system had sold over 10 million units worldwide, having reached its sales goal for the 2017 fiscal year within nine months. Nintendo raised its Switch sales expectation to 14 million units for the fiscal year. Shortly after this announcement, Kimishima said that Nintendo has a target of 20 million units sold within the console's second year, along with releasing new games that \"enables new ways of playing\" to continue the sales momentum.Based on its first year sales, the Switch was considered to be the fastest-selling game console in history in many regions. With 2017 year end Japanese sales data from Media Create, the Switch became the fastest-selling home console in Japan in first year sales, with its total sales of 3.2 million units exceeding the 3.0 million units of the PlayStation 2 during its first year of release, while Famitsu reported that these sales had eclipsed the lifetime sales of the Wii U in the country, and helped to support the first growth in sales within Japan's console market in eleven years. Nintendo of America also reported that with 4.8 million units sold in the United States by the end of 2017, 1.5 million units in December 2017 alone, the Switch was the fastest-selling console in the United States in its first 10 months, outpacing the Wii's performance of 4 million units in the same time period. Similarly, the Switch was the fastest-selling console in France, having sold 911,000 units through the end of 2017, according to Nintendo France. The Switch was also the fastest-selling console in Canada, having shipped 400,000 units in its first 10 months, narrowly outpacing the Wii's performance of 392,000 units in the same time period, according to TechVibes. According to analysis firm GBH Insights, the Nintendo Switch was the fifth-best-selling technology product in 2017. As of January 2018, the Switch has sold more than 300,000 units in Spain, surpassing the total lifetime sales of one of its competitors, the Xbox One, in the region. The Switch sold 8.7 million units in the United States in its first 21 months of availability, surpassing the sales of Xbox One and PlayStation 4 during their first 21 months in the same region. By May 2019, the Switch had overtaken the PS4's lifetime sales in Japan.\n\nLifetime sales\nAs of March 31, 2022, Nintendo has shipped 107.65 million Switch units, with over 83.45 million original Switch units, 18.40 million Switch Lite units, and 5.80 million Switch OLED units. With these numbers the Switch has surpassed lifetime sales of the Wii U (13.6 million units), GameCube (21.7 million units), Nintendo 64 (32.9 million units), Super Nintendo Entertainment System (49.1 million units), Nintendo Entertainment System (61.9 million units), Nintendo 3DS (75.92 million units), Game Boy Advance (81.51 million units), and Wii (101.63 million units). The rate of sales of the Switch, based on the number of months to reach 50 million units, had outpaced both the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and was on par with the PlayStation 2 and the Nintendo DS. Since October 2020, the Switch had been the highest selling console in the United States for 22 consecutive months, starting from December 2018, taking the record from the Xbox 360 which stood for 21 months (August 2011 (2011-08) \u2013 April 2013 (2013-05)). In the United States, the Switch had remained the best-selling console on monthly sales based on NPD Group data for 33 months from November 2018 through August 2021, with the PlayStation 5 breaking its streak in September 2021.\nOver 681 million software titles have been sold for the Switch as of September 30, 2021. According to Nintendo of America's Doug Bowser, the Switch has had an attach rate (games purchased per unit) of over 8 over its first four years. Top sellers for the platform, exceeding 10 million units sold worldwide include:\nMario Kart 8 Deluxe \u2013 45.33 million\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons \u2013 38.64 million\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate \u2013 28.17 million\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild \u2013 26.55 million\nPok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield \u2013 24.27 million\nSuper Mario Odyssey \u2013 23.50 million\nSuper Mario Party \u2013 17.78 million\nPok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl \u2013 14.65 million\nPok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! \u2013 14.53 million\nRing Fit Adventure \u2013 14.09 million\nNew Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe \u2013 13.31 million\nSplatoon 2 \u2013 13.30 million\nPok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus - 12.64 million\nLuigi\u2019s Mansion 3 \u2013 11.43 million\n\nFinancial impact\nNintendo's business performance, which had been struggling for several years, soared upon the release of the Switch. By May 23, 2017, the success of the Switch's launch raised Nintendo's stock price to its highest levels in seven years, and an increase in price of over 100% from the previous year. However, the price still trailed Nintendo's peak price by about half, back in 2007 when it had just released the Wii. Nintendo's stock was further boosted a few days later to meet its eight-year high following Capcom's announcement of plans to release the popular Monster Hunter XX for the Switch.In September 2017, Nintendo announced a partnership with Tencent, the leading publisher for mobile games in China, to bring their title Arena of Valor, the international version of their mainland Chinese game Wangzhe Rongyao, to the Switch following its December 2017 release in Western markets on mobile platforms. At the time, the game had an estimated 200 million players, most in China, and analysts anticipated that Nintendo would be releasing the Switch in China by 2019 as part of this deal. As a result, Nintendo's stock price rose overnight on the news by 7%, reaching a nine-year high. Nintendo's stock reached its ten-year high shortly after the October 2017 expansion of Switch production to 2 million units per month and speculation that Nintendo would likely start selling the unit in China sooner than anticipated.Nintendo's quarterly reports, for the period ending September 30, 2017, showed a profit of $209 million, the first profitable quarter in several years, due to both success of the Switch and its mobile gaming strategy. For similar reasons, its following quarter, ending December 31, 2017, was Nintendo's most profitable quarter since 2009, with year-to-year revenues increased by 177%.Nintendo's quarterly profit jumped by 44% in the first fiscal quarter of 2018 and their net profit totalled $274.9 million during April\u2013June 2018 due to new titles being released for the Switch such as Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze. Sales of the Switch and its games helped increase Nintendo's operating profit by 30% during July\u2013September 2018 and helped Nintendo reach its highest quarterly result in 8 years. Nintendo's quarterly profit jumped by 25% in the third fiscal quarter of 2018 due to the popularity of games on the Switch and their October\u2013December profit totalled $956 million, while quarterly sales totalled $5.6 billion, which were up by 26%.Nintendo's yearly profit jumped by 39% during the April 2018\u2013March 2019 fiscal year, and annual sales rose 14% to $10.7 billion due to \"healthy\" software sales for the Switch.\n\nLegal issues\nIn August 2017, Los Angeles-based tablet peripheral manufacturer Gamevice, Inc. filed a lawsuit against Nintendo in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleging that the design of the Switch conflicts with its patent on the design for the Wikipad, an Android-based gaming device that also features a tablet with a detachable controller. The lawsuit sought damages on existing Switch sales and banning further sales of the console. The lawsuit was voluntarily dismissed by Gamevice in October 2017.However, in March 2018, Gamevice initiated a second patent infringement lawsuit on Nintendo related to a different set of patents. Gamevice also sought action through the United States International Trade Commission related to patent infringement under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, and was seeking to block imports of the Switch into the United States. The lawsuit would be terminated on October 10, 2019, with no such violations being found. By March 2020, the United States Patent and Trademark Office had reviewed Gamevice's patents and deemed all of its claims to be unpatentable, a ruling in favor of Nintendo. Gamevice stated they would be challenging the Office's decision.While appealing the Patent Office's determination on its patents, Gamevice initiated a third infringement claim against Nintendo in March 2020 against a newly published patent it had obtained in August based on a game controller that would wrap around a smart phone. Gamevice sought to block imports of the Switch from Japan while the lawsuit was in progress. The lawsuit ended in favour of Nintendo.A class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington in July 2019 concerning a joystick defect in the console's Joy-Con controllers, commonly referred to as \"drift\". The suit alleges that Nintendo is aware of a defect that causes the controllers to register movements without the joysticks being touched, but does not \"disclose the defect and routinely refuses to repair the joysticks without charge\". Three days after the filing, an internal Nintendo company memo was leaked by Vice; the memo instructed Nintendo's customer service employees in North America to begin offering repairs for drifting Joy-Con controllers free of charge regardless of warranty status. The lawsuit, however, continued, and following the release of the Nintendo Switch Lite where some on social media reported the Joy-Con drift problem after 20 hours of play, additional complaints related to the Lite were added to the lawsuit. While the court refused to grant Nintendo a dismissal of the case, it did agree to send the case into arbitration as a first step as outlined in the EULA for the Switch in a ruling made in March 2020.Nintendo successfully obtained an injunction in December 2019 against a distributor of a hack made by Team Xecuter that enabled Switch users to obtain and run copyright-violating copies of Switch games on the console. Subsequently, Nintendo filed lawsuits initially against several resellers of Team Xecuter products in 2020, and in one case, settled with the reseller for $2 million. After members of Team Xecuter were arrested and charged with eleven felony counts by the United States Department of Justice in October 2020, Nintendo filed another lawsuit against one of the arrested members, Gary Bowser, asserting two counts of trafficking and one count of copyright infringement.\n\nSee also\nYuzu (emulator), a Nintendo Switch emulator\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website",
    "Horizon Zero Dawn": "Horizon Zero Dawn is a 2017 action role-playing game developed by Guerrilla Games and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. The plot follows Aloy, a young huntress in a world overrun by machines, who sets out to uncover her past. The player uses ranged weapons, a spear, and stealth to combat mechanical creatures and other enemy forces. A skill tree provides the player with new abilities and bonuses. The player can explore the open world to discover locations and take on side quests. It was released for the PlayStation 4 in 2017 and Microsoft Windows in 2020.\nHorizon Zero Dawn is Guerrilla Games' first intellectual property since Killzone in 2004 and its first role-playing game.  Development began in 2011 after the completion of Killzone 3, with director Mathijs de Jonge considering it the riskiest idea pitched at the time. The game engine, Decima, was developed for Killzone: Shadow Fall and altered for Horizon Zero Dawn. Being set in a post-apocalyptic setting, anthropologists were consulted to authenticate the world's decay over a millennium. The soundtrack was led by composer Joris de Man, featuring contributions from The Flight.\nHorizon Zero Dawn was praised by critics for its open world, story, visuals, combat, characterization, and the performance of voice actress Ashly Burch; however, the dialogue, melee combat, and character models received some criticism. The game won numerous awards and sold over 20 million copies by February 2022, making it one of the best-selling PlayStation 4 games. An expansion, The Frozen Wilds, was released in November 2017. A sequel, Horizon Forbidden West, was released for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on 18 February 2022.\n\nGameplay\nHorizon Zero Dawn is an action role-playing game played from a third-person view. Players take control of Aloy, a hunter who ventures through a post-apocalyptic land ruled by robotic creatures. Aloy can kill enemies in a variety of ways \u2013 setting traps such as tripwires using the Tripcaster, shooting them with arrows, using explosives, and a spear. Machine components, including electricity and the metal they are composed of, are vital to Aloy's survival; she can loot their remains for crafting resources. Ammo, resource satchels, pouches, quivers, resistance, antidotes, health potions, and traps can all be crafted. Weapons have modification slots for dealing more damage. Aloy wears a Focus, a small head piece that scans machines to determine their susceptibilities, identify their location, their level, and the nature of loot they will drop. One machine, the Stalker, can enable cloaking technology to avert the gaze of Aloy's Focus scan. Machines attack with defensive and offensive measures, and in either case react to a perceived threat by charging at it with brute force or projectiles. Exhibiting the behaviour of wild animals, some machines are inclined to move in herds, and others, with the ability to fly, do so in flocks. Unless hacked with the Override Tool, or sufficiently hit with corruption arrows, machines do not exert aggressive force against each other. Aloy also engages in battle with human enemies, such as bandits and the Eclipse cult.Aloy can dodge, sprint, slide, or roll to evade her enemies' advances. Hiding in foliage to ambush nearby enemies can ensure immediate takedowns. Swimming may reach enemies stealthily or places otherwise unreachable on foot. She is able to hack a selection of machines with the Override Tool, some of which can be turned into makeshift mounts. Explorable ruins called Cauldrons unlock additional machines to override. Three categories occur in the skill tree: \"Prowler\" concerns stealth, \"Brave\" improves combat, and \"Forager\" increases healing and gathering capabilities. To level up, Aloy attains experience points from individual kills and completing quests. Upgrades in each category result in more adept use of the skills learned, with \"Prowler\" leading to silent takedowns, \"Brave\" to aiming a bow in slow motion, and \"Forager\" to an enlarged medicine pouch. The Frozen Wilds added \"Traveler\", which unlocks the ability to jump off a mount to attack enemies. The game has a seamless open world with a day-night cycle and dynamic weather system.The map is composed of forest, jungle, desert, and snowy mountain regions. Mountainous terrain is traversed with the employment of parkour, and aided by the use of zip-lines. Corrupted Zones constitute areas that heighten difficulty and are populated by corrupted machines that behave with more aggression. To uncover more of the map, Aloy must scale large giraffe-like machines known as Tallnecks. Twenty-five robotic creature designs are present in the game. Save points and fast travel can be accessed by interacting with campfires, once discovered. The quest structure unfolds to accommodate the exploration of tribes, while the main story covers the entire world. Side quests involve Aloy completing tasks, like gathering materials, coming to the aid of individuals in danger of being killed, solving mysteries, assuming control of bandit camps, eliminating criminals and more difficult machines, accomplishing various challenges at any of the five Hunting Grounds, and obtaining an ancient armour that makes Aloy almost impervious to damage. A dialogue wheel is used to communicate with non-player characters. Collectibles include vantages that offer visual information of the Old World, metal flowers that contain poetry, and old relics, such as ancient mugs and tribal artifacts.\n\nSynopsis\nSetting\nThe story is set in a post-apocalyptic United States, between the states of Colorado, Wyoming and Utah, in the 31st century. Humans live in scattered, primitive tribes with varying levels of technological development. Their technologically advanced predecessors are remembered as the \"Old Ones\". Large robotic creatures, known as \"machines\", dominate the Earth. For the most part, they peacefully coexist with humans, who occasionally hunt them for parts. However, a phenomenon known as the \"Derangement\" has caused machines to become more aggressive towards humans, and larger and deadlier machines have begun to appear. There are four tribes that are prominently featured: the Nora, the Banuk, the Carja and the Oseram. The Nora are fierce hunter-gatherers who live in the mountains and worship nature as the \"All-Mother\". The Carja are desert-dwelling city builders who worship the Sun. The Banuk consists of wandering clans made up of hunters and shamans who live in snowy mountains and worship the machines and their \"songs\". The Oseram are tinkerers and salvagers known for their metalworking, brewing, and talent as warriors.\n\nPlot\nAloy (Ashly Burch) is cast out from the Nora tribe at birth and raised by a fellow outcast named Rost (JB Blanc). As a child (Ava Potter), Aloy obtains a Focus, an augmented reality device that gives her special perceptive abilities. Aloy becomes curious about her origins and is told by Rost that if she wins the Proving, a competition to earn the right to become a member of the Nora, the tribe's Matriarchs might concede this information. Aloy spends some years training in combat and survival under Rost's instruction.\nAfter coming of age, Aloy takes part in the Proving; she wins the competition, but the Nora are attacked by masked cultists. Rost sacrifices himself to save Aloy from their leader, Helis (Crispin Freeman). When Aloy awakens, the Matriarchs explain that Aloy was found as an infant before a sealed door within the Nora's sacred mountain. The Matriarchs name Aloy a \"Seeker\", allowing her to leave their lands in pursuit of the cultists. Aloy meets Oseram member Olin (Chook Sibtain), who informs Aloy that the cultists are part of a splinter Carja faction called the Eclipse, and indicates that Aloy was targeted due to her resemblance to an Old World scientist named Elisabet Sobeck (also voiced by Burch). Aloy locates the ruined corporate campus of Faro Automated Solutions and discovers that the Old World was destroyed nearly a thousand years ago after Faro lost control of its automated peacekeeper military robots. The robots, which could self-replicate and consumed biomass, overran the planet and consumed the biosphere, stripping Earth of life. Zero Dawn, a project spearheaded by Sobeck, was initiated to create an automated terraforming system to deactivate the robots and restore life to Earth.Aloy is contacted by Sylens (Lance Reddick), a secretive figure interested in uncovering the fate of the Old Ones. Aloy learns that Sobeck was sent to a decommissioned Orbital Launch Base to complete Zero Dawn, which is located under the Citadel, the centre of Eclipse power. Inside the base, Aloy learns that Zero Dawn was a vast underground system of databases, factories, and cloning facilities controlled by a single artificial intelligence, GAIA (Lesley Ewen). Once all life had been extinguished, GAIA developed a countermeasure to deactivate the Faro robots and build its own to restore the Earth's biosphere. Once the planet was habitable again, GAIA's next goal was to reseed life on Earth based on stored DNA and teach the first human clones not to repeat their predecessors' mistakes. However, APOLLO, the subsystem designed to teach humanity, was sabotaged by Faro's founder and CEO Theodore Faro in a fit of nihilism, and the first humans were reduced to a tribal, subsistence society. The Eclipse are secretly controlled by HADES (John Gonzalez), another of GAIA's subsystems designed to enact controlled extinction if the outcome of Zero Dawn was not favorable for human existence. Reaching Sobeck's office, Aloy obtains a registry to give her access to the door beneath the Nora's mountain. She is captured by Helis and sentenced to death at the Citadel, but escapes with the help of Sylens. Aloy helps the Nora fight off the Eclipse and unlocks the mountain's door.She finds a recording from GAIA, revealing that a signal of unknown origin caused HADES to activate and seize control of her functions; as a last resort, GAIA self-destructed in order to stop HADES. Without GAIA to maintain the terraforming process, the entire system began to break down. As a contingency plan, GAIA created a clone of Sobeck in the form of Aloy, in the hope that she would find GAIA's message, destroy HADES, and restore GAIA's functions. Aloy learns that Sobeck sacrificed her life to ensure the Faro robots would not find GAIA. Aloy manages to obtain the master override to destroy HADES. Sylens reveals that he was the founder of the Eclipse, originally tempted by HADES' promises of knowledge. They surmise that HADES intends to send a signal to reactivate the Faro robots to extinguish life on Earth. Aloy kills Helis and helps fight off machines, before stabbing HADES and activating the master override, ending the war. She journeys to Sobeck's old home, finding her corpse, and mourns her predecessor. In a post-credits scene, an alive HADES is trapped by Sylens, who intends to interrogate HADES to find out who sent the signal that activated it.\n\nThe Frozen Wilds\nAloy travels to the \"Cut\", the home of the Banuk tribe, after hearing word of dangerous machines appearing and a mountain belching smoke. She learns from Aratak (Richard Neil), chieftain of the largest Banuk clan, that the Banuk have been attempting to battle a \"Daemon\" on the mountain, \"Thunder's Drum\", which has corrupted the machines of the Cut. However, their first attack had been a failure, and their shaman, Ourea, had disappeared afterwards. Aloy searches for Ourea, coming across strange robotic towers which both control and repair the corrupted machines. She finds Ourea (Necar Zadegan) in an Old World facility that had been converted into a Banuk shrine and is housing an artificial intelligence the shaman calls the \"Spirit\". Aloy is able to make contact with the Spirit, which warns Ourea that the Daemon is blocking its transmissions before being cut off. Aloy and Ourea agree to work together to save the Spirit. Per Ourea's advice, Aloy defeats Aratak in a hunting competition, taking his place as chieftain. She also discovers that Aratak and Ourea are siblings.Aloy, Ourea, and Aratak head for Thunder's Drum. They infiltrate the Old World facility built inside the mountain, where Aloy discovers that the Spirit is actually CYAN (Laurel Lefkow), a highly advanced AI designed to prevent the Yellowstone Caldera from erupting. Traveling further inside, they discover that the Daemon has already overtaken much of the facility, but CYAN suggests using lava from the caldera to destroy the infected areas while preserving the facility. It is also revealed that the Daemon is in fact HEPHAESTUS (Stefan Ashton Frank), another of GAIA's subsystems that manufactures machines. The group fights through HEPHAESTUS' defenses and Ourea sacrifices herself to override CYAN's core, allowing it to escape. CYAN transfers its core systems to an auxiliary data center and initiates self-destruction of the facility. Aloy and Aratak narrowly escape. Aloy returns to the Banuk Shrine, where CYAN is waiting; the AI provides additional information about the Old World but warns that HEPHAESTUS is still active somewhere and will continue to build machines designed specifically to kill humans, which is why it tried to seize control of CYAN and its facilities. Returning Aratak to his previous position as Chieftain, Aloy departs the Cut.\n\nDevelopment\nGuerrilla Games began developing Horizon Zero Dawn following the release of Killzone 3 in 2011. When conceiving the idea for a new game, about 40 concepts were pitched. Among these was Horizon Zero Dawn, which game director Mathijs de Jonge considered \"the most risky\" of the concepts and was pitched in 2010 by art director Jan-Bart van Beek. When this concept was chosen, a team of 10\u201320 began building prototypes of the game. Approximately 20 different stories were written for the game, exploring varying concepts for the game, such as different player characters. John Gonzalez, who previously acted as lead writer for Fallout: New Vegas (2010), was hired to write the game's story as narrative director, with Ben McCaw as lead writer. The main elements of the story and the character of Aloy remained intact since early development. Upon the completion of Killzone: Shadow Fall in late 2013, the remainder of the staff began working on Horizon Zero Dawn. Guerrilla cancelled another game to allow the entire team to focus on the development of Horizon. Sony would later admit to being reluctant about having the main character be female and conducted focus testing to see if such a decision was marketable. The game had an estimated budget of over \u20ac45 million.The game's concept explores the juxtaposition between the danger and beauty of the world, particularly analysing the concept of humanity not being the dominant species. The team aimed to emphasise the game's exploration element by featuring a quest system, as well as including items throughout the world that can be used to craft or replenish health. The team wished for the game to have a simple user interface design, specifically avoiding complicated menus for crafting, and considered the game to be a technical challenge. They felt that the game engine, Decima, which was designed for games such as the Killzone series and was previously used for Killzone: Shadow Fall, was difficult to alter for Horizon, in terms of draw distance and loading. To discover how some game elements work differently in open world games, the team sought help from talent in the design, art and technical fields. In extrapolating the game world, Guerrilla turned to anthropologists and researched the formation of tribal cultures as well as how building materials would decay over a millennium. The game's quest system and narrative design took inspiration from other role-playing video games, ranging from the \"Relaxed\" quest design of RPG Maker games to the \"Strict\" quest design of hack and slash games. They defined \"Relaxed\" quest design as having few centralised systems for managing quest progression, and \"Strict\" quest design as having a rigid structure and predefined elements, with the team deciding the latter.\n\nLance Reddick and Ashly Burch's involvement was revealed in January 2017. Burch voiced Aloy, whose likeness was portrayed by Hannah Hoekstra and motion capture was performed by Amanda Piery in London. Following an auditioning process in 2014, Burch was called in to do the E3 2015 trailer and proceeded to work on the game for two years in Los Angeles, providing facial motion capture as well.The game's soundtrack was composed by Joris de Man, The Flight, Niels van der Leest, and Jonathan Williams, with vocalist Julie Elven serving as the primary performer. Lucas van Tol, music supervisor and senior sound designer, provided the composers with a game design document, insisting on an intimate sound for the score. For the tribal theme, they experimented with bows on piano wire and resonator guitars (with layered tracks of harmonicas on top of the latter) and playing cellos with plectrums or the back of a bow to convey how contemporary instruments would be played by someone to whom the instruments were unknown; de Man also used a contrabass flute and made synth pads from blowing on a Thai bamboo flute, noting \"distant pads and ambiences, and wide, spread out chords seemed to work well\". Circuit-bent synthesizers and percussive loops, run through impulse responses of metal and iron being beaten, were devoted to making a thematic identifier for the machines based on technology and metal. Van Tol required that the music be supplied in stems so that different pieces could be combined. The positive response to the first E3 trailer's main theme led it to be included in the main menu. The composers also did the motion capture for diegetic music vignettes, portraying in-game tribal musicians. The four-hour soundtrack was released via digital music platforms on 10 March 2017.\n\nRelease\nThe concept art as well as the game's codename, Horizon, were leaked in September 2014. Horizon Zero Dawn was officially announced during Sony's E3 2015 press conference. The game was featured as the cover story in the September 2015 issue of Edge and the October 2016 issue of Game Informer. At E3 2016, Sony had a life-sized cosplay version of one of the machines greet the trade show attendees. Originally set to be released in 2016, the game was delayed to February 2017 to be further polished. It was released to manufacturing in late January 2017, and launched to North American markets on 28 February 2017, in Europe, Australia and New Zealand on 1 March and Asia on 2 March for the PlayStation 4. Horizon Zero Dawn is forward compatible with the PS4 Pro, allowing it to run up to 4K resolution. In April 2017, a making-of documentary was released on Dutch public television. By March 2017, a story expansion had already been set in motion. New Game Plus, an Ultra Hard difficulty mode, additional trophies and aesthetic features were introduced with a patch released in July 2017. The expansion, The Frozen Wilds, was released on 7 November 2017. The Complete Edition, which contains the base game, The Frozen Wilds, and all additional downloadable content (DLC), was released for the PlayStation 4 on 5 December 2017 and Microsoft Windows via Steam on 7 August 2020 and GOG on 24 November 2020. A tabletop game adaptation is being developed by Steamforged Games.\n\nReception\nHorizon Zero Dawn received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Destructoid's Chris Carter commended Ashly Burch and Lance Reddick for their performances, with the character of Aloy receiving credit for maintaining a \"captivating\" and \"interesting\" consistency in the narrative and action sequences. Carter also lauded the focus on exploration and discovery, which he said grew more effective as he traversed more of the land. The game world itself was subject to compliment for its \"beautiful\" day-night cycle and weather system. According to Carter, the challenging nature of the machines and varied methods with which to battle them brought a real sense of fun to the combat. Matt Buchholtz of EGMNow likewise praised Burch as well as the game world, which he found to be mesmerising. Considered the most powerful part of the game, the Focus feature gained approval for complementing the combat in a way that \"forces you to become a hunter\". Writing for Game Informer, Jeff Marchiafava opined that, unlike with other open world video games, searching for audio logs and emails provided the plot with a \"remarkable sense of discovery\". He was thankful that story-based missions dominated the overall experience, arguing that they worked to detail the world and inspired gameplay variation.Peter Brown at GameSpot reflected on Aloy's character development with amazement. One constant thrill to Brown came from combating the machines, which he said took the spotlight and never lost its flair. He appreciated also that the main quests encouraged one to explore the environment. Zoe Delahunty-Light, writing for GamesRadar+, was fascinated with the intricacies of the world and found integral value in the lore scattered among the ruins. She echoed Brown's view that fighting machines maintained excitement throughout. Giant Bomb's Jeff Gerstmann declared Horizon Zero Dawn as \"a near-perfect story\" with a satisfying conclusion, and emphasised that it contained substantial depth. Lucy O'Brien at IGN admired its weight in meaning, while welcoming the charm of the protagonist's personality. A considerable impression was made with the combat, which was stated as the most compelling accomplishment. Writing for Polygon, Philip Kollar applauded the game as what he dubbed the \"refutation\" of Guerrilla Games' past work, a change of pace he described as \"refreshing\". Aloy was observed to be perfectly coupled with the story in that she offered the curiosity to seek out its many mysteries. Kollar perceived the Focus as \"key to combat\" and the machines as engaging foes in battle. Colm Ahern of VideoGamer.com wrote in his verdict, \"Destroying large robot beasts while frantically switching between weapons is intoxicating, but the strength of Horizon Zero Dawn is in Aloy's engaging quest to find out who she really is\".Conversely, Carter saw the characters beyond Aloy and Sylens as uninteresting and bland in their designs. He also disparaged the human artificial intelligence as being worse than that of the machines. To Buchholtz, the weapon system in relation to ammunition appeared convoluted; the ability to only purchase one item at a time \"a massive oversight\"; and Aloy's ability to only grab marked ledges was confusing for a \"parkour master\". Marchiafava's only major criticism was that it held too familiar roots with established open world formula. Although Brown drew enjoyment from other aspects of combat, he disparaged the melee for its ineffectiveness and simplicity. Delahunty-Light concurred that the melee fell short of its potential, and also took issue with the jumping mechanic. O'Brien felt the dialogue occasionally contradicted the otherwise intelligent narrative. Kollar bemoaned the character models as its one visual shortcoming.Game director Yoko Taro listed it as one of his favourite PlayStation 4 games. Entertainment Weekly ranked it as the fourth best game of 2017, GamesRadar+ ranked it second on their list of the 25 Best Games of 2017, and Eurogamer ranked it 31st on their list of the \"Top 50 Games of 2017\". The Verge named Horizon Zero Dawn as one of the 15 Best Games of 2017. In Game Informer's Reader's Choice Best of 2017 Awards, it took the lead for \"Best Sony Game\", coming up in second place for both \"Best Action Game\" and \"Game of the Year\". Game Informer also awarded it \"Best Sony Exclusive\" in their Best of 2017 Awards, and also gave it the awards for \"Best Story\" and \"Best Character\" (Aloy) in their 2017 Action Game of the Year Awards. EGMNow ranked the game third in their list of 25 Best Games of 2017, while Polygon ranked it eighth on their list of the 50 best games of 2017. The game won the Gold Prize and Users Choice Prize at the 2017 PlayStation Awards. It was nominated for \"Best PS4 Game\" at Destructoid's Game of the Year Awards 2017. It also won the awards for \"Best PlayStation 4 Game\" and \"Best Graphics\" at IGN's Best of 2017 Awards, whereas its other nominations were for \"Game of the Year\", \"Best Action-Adventure Game\", and \"Best Art Direction\". It was nominated for \"Best Looking Game\" at Giant Bomb's 2017 Game of the Year Awards. In 2018, it won the awards for Best PS4 Game, Best Performance for Ashly Burch, Best Art Direction, Best Soundtrack, Best Story, Best Post-Release Content, Best PlayStation Console Exclusive, and Best Use of PS4 Pro at PlayStation Blog's Game of the Year Awards.\n\nSales\nHorizon Zero Dawn was the best-selling game during its release week in the UK.

    "Genshin Impact": "Genshin Impact is an action role-playing game developed and published by video game company miHoYo. It was released for Microsoft Windows, Playstation 4, iOS, and Android in 2020, and on Playstation 5 in 2021. The game is also set for release on Nintendo Switch. The game features an  anime-style open-world environment and an action-based battle system using elemental magic and character-switching. The game is free-to-play and is monetized through gacha game mechanics where players can obtain new characters and weapons. The base game is expanded on a regular basis through patches using the games as a service model.\nGenshin Impact takes place in the fantasy world of Teyvat, which is home to seven distinct nations, each of which is tied to a different element and ruled by a different god. The story follows the Traveler, who has traveled across countless worlds with their twin sibling before becoming separated in Teyvat. The Traveler travels in search of the lost sibling with their companion Paimon and becomes involved in the affairs of Teyvat's nations.\nDevelopment began in 2017 and is currently ongoing. The game received generally positive reviews, with critics praising the game's combat mechanics and open-world immersiveness, but criticized its simplistic endgame and monetization model. A commercial success, the game grossed more than $3 billion in its first year of release, the highest ever first-year launch revenue for any video game.\n\nGameplay\nGenshin Impact is an open-world action role-playing game that allows the player to control one of four interchangeable characters in a party. Switching between characters can be done quickly during combat, allowing the player to use several different combinations of skills and attacks. Characters may have their strengths enhanced in various ways, such as increasing a character's level and improving artifacts and the weapons that the character equips. In addition to exploration, the player can attempt various challenges for rewards. Scattered across Teyvat are bosses and challenges that reward highly valuable resources, such as Stormterror and the Electro Hypostasis, but claiming them uses up a currency called resin, which slowly regenerates over time. Completing these challenges grants the player progress towards increasing their Adventure Rank, which in turn unlocks new quests, challenges, and raises the World Level. The World Level is a measure of how strong the enemies within the world are and the rarity of rewards that defeating them gives.The player can control their character and perform actions such as running, climbing, swimming, and gliding which are limited by stamina. Some characters possess abilities that can alter the environment, such as freezing water to create an ice path that can aid the player in traversing terrain. Many teleportation nodes exist throughout the world that players can warp to as a form of fast travel; among these are landmarks known as Statues of The Seven that can heal and revive characters, and provide benefits such as increasing player stamina. Items such as food and ore may be procured from the open world, while enemies and treasure chests drop other types of resources that may be used in enhancing a character's strength. Players can obtain food from hunting animals, gathering fruit and vegetables, or purchasing them from a store. Ingredients that can be cooked into meals that regenerate characters' health or boost various stats. Players can also procure ore that can be refined and then used to create weapons or enhance their strength.\n\nEach character has two unique combat skills: an Elemental Skill and an Elemental Burst. The Elemental Skill can be used at any time except for the cooldown period immediately after use. In contrast, the Elemental Burst has an energy cost, requiring the user to amass sufficient elemental energy by defeating enemies or inflicting elemental status effects. Characters have control over one of seven natural elements: Cryo, Dendro, Pyro, Hydro, Anemo, Electro and Geo; which correspond to ice, grass, fire, water, wind, thunder, and rock respectively. These elements can interact in different ways; for example, if a Hydro attack hits a target, the enemy will be inflicted with the \"Wet\" status effect, and if they are hit with a Cryo attack, it will inflict \"Cryo\". These two status effects combine into the \"Frozen\" status effect, temporarily preventing the target from performing any actions or until the player deals enough physical damage to the enemy. Switching between characters during combat and executing those skills allows those elemental interactions to take place. Certain elemental abilities may be required to solve puzzles within the overworld.A multiplayer mode is available in the form of co-op. Up to 4 players can play together in the overworld and join Domains. Player matching can either be done by requesting to connect with another player. If the player wishes to clear a Domain with other players, they will be automatically matched up with others looking to tackle the same objective. The game features cross-platform play, so players on any platform can play with each other.By completing quests to advance the story, the player can initially unlock four additional playable characters, and more characters can be obtained via a gacha mechanic and in-game events. Several premium in-game currencies, obtainable through in-app purchases and playing the game, can be used to obtain characters and weapons through the gacha system. A pity system guarantees that the player will receive rare items after a set number of draws.\n\nStory\nSetting\nGenshin Impact takes place in the world of Teyvat, and is composed of the seven major nations of Mondstadt, Liyue, Inazuma, Sumeru, Fontaine, Natlan, and Snezhnaya; each nation is ruled by a different god. The mysterious floating island of Celestia is allegedly home to gods and mortals who have ascended to godhood through great, heroic feats. Underground lie the ruins of the nation of Khaenri'ah which was destroyed by gods 500 years before the events of the game. Unlike the seven major nations, Khaenri'ah was not ruled over by a god. The player character, the Traveler (male or female depending on the player's choice), is separated from their twin and becomes trapped in Teyvat. They are joined by a companion, Paimon, as they journey through Teyvat in search of their lost sibling. Although players can choose the name they want to be referred by, the Traveler's sibling refers to the Traveler by either Aether or Lumine, if the Traveler is male or female, respectively.\nEach nation is associated with and worships one of The Seven, a group of gods known as the \"Archons\", who each preside over one of the seven nations. Each member of The Seven is tied to one of the game's elements, and is also reflected in their nation's aspect. Barbatos, Rex Lapis, the Raiden Shogun and the Tsaritsa are the Archons of Mondstadt, Liyue, Inazuma and Snezhnaya, respectively. However, the god who is the Archon may change over time as Archons pass away. Specific individuals chosen by the Archons are granted a Vision\u2014magical gemstones that give their bearers the ability to command an element and the potential to ascend to godhood and reside in Celestia.Mondstadt, the city of freedom, worships the Anemo Archon Barbatos and sits on an island in the middle of a lake. The city is protected by the Knights of Favonius, who are tasked with protecting Mondstadt and its citizens. To the southwest, Liyue worships the Geo Archon Rex Lapis (also known as Morax) and is the largest market harbor in Teyvat. The harbor city is presided over by the Liyue Qixing, a group of business leaders, and ancient guardians known as Adepti, a class of magical beings that includes Rex Lapis himself. Across the sea to the southeast lies the isolationist island nation of Inazuma, overseen by the authoritarian regime of the Raiden Shogun (also known as Baal) and three governmental bodies that together make up the Tri-Commission: the Tenryou Commission, Kanjou Commission, and Yashiro Commission; overseeing military and executive affairs, finances and foreign affairs, and ceremonial affairs respectively.Snezhnaya, ruled by the Cryo Archon known as the Tsaritsa, sends out diplomats named the Fatui who maintain a friendly appearance while using more underhanded methods secretly. The Fatui are also led by the Eleven Harbingers, individuals given extraordinary powers and executive authority by the Tsaritsa.  In addition to the Fatui, another antagonistic faction in the game is the Abyss Order, a legion of monsters that declares themselves to be enemies to all of humanity. They are led by the \"Prince\" or \"Princess\", the lost sibling of the Traveler.\n\nPlot\nA pair of twins who travel across different worlds arrive in Teyvat, but attempt to leave after finding the nation of Khaenri'ah under cataclysmic siege. However, they are separated by a god who takes one twin and seals away the other away. The sealed twin, referred to as the  \"Traveler\", awakens five hundred years later and meets Paimon, and the two embark on a journey to find the missing twin.\nThe duo first arrive in the city of Mondstadt, which has been under attack from a dragon called Stormterror. They meet with Venti, a local bard who wishes to calm Stormterror, who is actually Dvalin, one of the ancient protectors of Mondstadt. Retrieving a stolen holy lyre from the Fatui, Venti attempts to calm Dvalin down with the lyre, but the dragon is manipulated into attacking him by the Abyss Order. The encounter also reveals Venti to be the Anemo Archon Barbatos, and they pursue Dvalin and free him from the Abyss Order's influence. After solving the crisis, Venti is ambushed by Fatui Harbinger La Signora, who steals his Gnosis, the symbol of an Archon's power.\nVenti advises the Traveler to travel to Liyue next to meet Rex Lapis, the Geo Archon at a ceremony. However, at the ceremony Rex Lapis is apparently killed, and his body is hidden away. Needing to escape suspicion, the Traveler gets help from funeral parlor consultant Zhongli and Fatui Harbinger Childe; the latter manipulates the Traveler into sowing conflict between the Qixing, the organization of trade heads who administer Liyue Harbor, and the Adepti, ancient guardians who defend Liyue. Childe discovers the location of Rex Lapis' body, but is unable to find the Gnosis and believes Rex Lapis is still alive. To lure out the Archon, Childe resurrects an ancient god, but the combined forces of the Traveler, the Qixing, and the Adepti defeat it, after which the groups agree to usher Liyue into a new age. Afterwards, the Traveler discovers that Zhongli is Rex Lapis, who gives his Gnosis to Signora as part of a discreet contract with the Tsaritsa, the Cryo Archon and leader of the Fatui. Zhongli explains he faked his death so he could step down from his role as Archon, and their defense of Liyue proved they did not need his protection.The Traveler then returns to Mondstadt and meets a man named Dainsleif who is targeting the Abyss Order. Together they investigate their plot to create an artificial god to topple Celestia, but as they attempt to thwart it, they are confronted by the Traveler's sibling. They reveal themselves to be the leader of the Abyss Order, consisting of the people of Khaenri'ah cursed to become monsters, and reveal Dainsleif was a guard of Khaenri'ah cursed to wander the world. Dainsleif chases after their sibling but the Traveler is unable to follow.\nWhile looking for a way into Inazuma, the Traveler learns more of the Vision Hunt Decree being enforced to confiscate the Visions of those in Inazuma, starting a civil war. Arriving in the nation, the Traveler agrees to help the resistance army abolish it. They learn that the Fatui manipulated the Shogun into signing it and raid a Fatui facility in response, but are defeated by Fatui Harbinger Scaramouche. They are saved by shrine maiden Yae Miko, who tells them that the \"Raiden Shogun\" is actually a puppet created by Ei to rule Inazuma while she retreated into her mind. The Traveler confronts Signora at the Shogun's palace and challenges her to a duel and emerges victorious. Signora is executed by the Raiden Shogun, and the Traveler with help from Yae Miko defeat Ei, who repeals the decree, ending the war.Miko reveals that Ei's Gnosis was entrusted to her, and that she relinquished it to Scaramouche in order to spare the Traveler.The Traveler reunites with Dainsleif, who failed to find their sibling. Seeing a vision of their sibling attempting to restore Khaenri'ah, they are torn between helping their sibling and defeating the Abyss Order. Dainsleif declares that the Traveler must choose before departing.\n\nDevelopment\nGenshin Impact began development as early as late January 2017, with an initial team of 120 people, which grew to 400 by the end of that year, and reached 700 by February 2021. miHoYo revealed the game in June 2019 at E3 2019. The game was developed using the Unity Engine. The game had a development and marketing budget of around $100 million, making it one of the most expensive video games to develop. Between the announcement and release closed beta tests were held, allowing invited players to explore and interact with the open world. The game includes voice-overs in four languages, and 13 different languages for text.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is held in high regard by the development team, and is cited as one of the main inspirations for Genshin Impact. Development was aimed at making the game different and fun from other MMORPGs in terms of its quest and combat systems as well as its random events and mode of exploration. The game was designed to be cross-platform as developing the game for PC and console allowed the developers to raise graphical fidelity for the game, such as rendering realistic shadows. The overall artistic vision of the game is intended to combine anime art style with more key elements from real-world cultures. For example, Liyue was first conceived of as a reimagining of Chinese culture through a fantasy perspective, and was combined with reference material from Zhangjiajie National Forest Park and Tianmen Mountain to create the region.\n\nMusic\nYu-Peng Chen of HOYO-MiX composed the game's original score, which was performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, and the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra. The approach to creating the soundtrack is to immerse players within the game, and provide emotional and beautiful melodies. Based upon a foundation of Western music, the score also has regional and cultural influences added depending upon the region. For example, in Mondstadt Chen utilized woodwind instruments to reflect Mondstadt's association with wind and freedom. In contrast, the battle themes utilize polyphony and other composing techniques, as well as mimicking orchestrion elements from composers such as Beethoven. Several soundtrack albums featuring music about characters and regions of the game have been released periodically. For his work on the soundtrack Chen was awarded the \"Outstanding Artist\u2014Newcomer/Breakthrough\" at the 2020 Annual Game Music Awards. In an interview published on April 2021 Chen expressed interest in releasing the soundtracks on CD, as well as hosting concerts in the future. The first concert was held virtually on October 3, 2021, titled \"Melodies of an Endless Journey\" and featured multiple bands and an orchestra performing various soundtracks from the game. A second virtual concert was held on February 4, 2022, titled \"Reflections of Spring\" featuring the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra performing soundtracks from the Liyue region.\n\nRelease\nThe worldwide release, September 28, was announced on August 17 for PC and mobile platforms, and on August 28 it revealed that the Playstation 4 version would be releasing on the same date. The game was made available on PlayStation 5 through backwards compatibility on November 11. On April 28, 2021, the PlayStation 5 version of the game was released, featuring enhanced visuals, improved loading times, and DualSense controller support. The game will be released on Nintendo Switch, though no release window has been announced.Prior to its release the game had over 10 million registrations, with over half of that from outside China. According to some, the game was the biggest international release of any Chinese video game. In the lead up to release, the game won the Tokyo Game Show Media Awards 2020 public poll, ranking first among 14 other games.Shortly after the launch of the game, miHoYo announced a schedule for content updates over the following months. These content updates are planned to be implemented into the game every six weeks. Additional patches in the future will add more events and new areas of Teyvat. As a long-term project, much of the game remains to be finished. On release, only two of the seven major regions intended for the game were released, and miHoYo anticipates it will take several years for the game's story to be completed. In a presentation given in February 2021, miHoYo president Cai Haoyu estimated that ongoing development for the game would cost $200 million per year. Prior to the release of the game, miHoYo released a manga detailing the background of its characters and the fictional world of Teyvat, and other future plans include a line of comics, toys, and a possible movie.\n\nControversies\nWhen the game was first unveiled at the ChinaJoy convention in 2019, it was initially met with criticisms claiming that the game had similarities to Breath of the Wild. Zelda fans at the convention showed explicit gestures towards the Sony booth, with one individual destroying their PlayStation 4 console in protest.Shortly after release, players discovered that the game's kernel-based anti-cheat system would remain active after the game was closed or uninstalled, which raised concerns that the game had installed spyware. Some Japanese players using iOS devices also observed that the game read the contents of players' clipboards while starting up. miHoYo announced that both issues were the result of coding errors and have been addressed and fixed.On October 6, 2020, journalist and Twitch streamer Kazuma Hashimoto published a video on social media site Twitter demonstrating how Chinese political terms such as \"Hong Kong\" and \"Taiwan\" are censored within the in-game chat. As the developer of the game, miHoYo, is based in China, they are subject to China's censorship policy, which includes complying with a relatively large list of banned words that cannot be used in game or via chat. Other terms not related to Chinese politics are banned as well, such as \"Putin\", \"Hitler\", and \"Stalin\". Extending outside of purely political wordage, innocuous terms such as \"enemies\" and \"words\" were also being censored.In November 2020, the game was met with controversy during a character's release, Zhongli, due to his gameplay and kit being viewed as poor to the point where it was taken as an insult toward Chinese players. miHoYo initially replied to the controversy regarding the character, saying that it was working as intended and there should not be any worry over that. Later, miHoYo issued an apology, and promised to improve the character's kit, through beta testing for version 1.3.In March 2021, fast food company KFC announced a collaboration event in China that offered exclusive pins and in-game items to customers who turned up and shouted the phrase \"Meet in another world, enjoy delicious food!\" at the restaurant's employees. As a result, KFC outlets in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou were overrun with fans. Despite authorities' best efforts to maintain COVID-19 regulations, the promotion was forced to shut down.In April 2021, some called for a boycott of the game over claims of bigotry in the game's content. Some other users pointed out how the only playable characters with dark skin were described as \"exotic\" or \"scary\" in the game. Criticism was also aimed at one of the game's adult characters expressing love towards another character that appears to be a child, though this may have been an oversight as the character in question was noted to have used an adult model during earlier stages of development.The game's first anniversary celebrations in September 2021 received criticism due to the company's handling on the event. Fans of the game criticized the anniversary rewards in comparison to rewards for community events that favored content creators. miHoYo did not release any comment about the rewards, and the game was review-bombed by fans, driving its overall score in the Google Play Store down from 4.5 initially, to 1.9. miHoYo's other games, Honkai Impact 3rd and Tears of Themis received the same review-bombing by fans amidst the controversy. The company made a formal apology to the players in response to the review bombing, responding with making the paid bundle pack planned to be sold in the upcoming live concert as a free 4-day login gift. The company stated that: \"We\u2019ve been paying close attention to various feedback regarding Genshin Impact's first anniversary. We\u2019ve already come up with more celebrations including the coming Genshin Impact online concert and thank-you gifts to express our gratitude for players\u2019 support all the way along. The opinions and feedback from players and fans are really valuable to us, and we wish all fans will continue the adventure and collect more cherished memories in Teyvat.\"\n\nSecurity concerns\nThe game has been criticized for initially lacking security features ubiquitous on other sites, like two-factor authentication. On October 19, 2020, a vulnerable security flaw was discovered that exposed the phone number linked to a player's account during the password recovery attempt on the miHoYo website, however the issue was not rectified until November 9, 2020. miHoYo has issued notices following the wake of security exposures, informing players to be careful about sharing account details and to bind their account to their email address and phone number. In May 2021, two-factor authentication was added whenever the player signs in on a new device.Similar to other online games, the game utilizes an anti-cheat system implemented by a kernel driver. The driver is used to prevent other programs from performing code injection, memory inspection, and other process manipulation. Originally, the anti-cheat driver would remain loaded after the game exited.  This issue was rectified shortly after the game's release, and now unloads as soon as the game exits.\n\nReception\nGenshin Impact received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to review aggregator Metacritic. The open world of Teyvat drew praise; IGN's Travis Northup described Teyvat as \"a world that is absolutely bursting at the seams with possibilities\", and Hardcore Gamer's Jordan Helm described it as \"one big environmental puzzle\". Liyue in particular was picked out by Kotaku's Sisi Jiang for being \"one of the most exciting regions that I've visited in a video game in years\", before continuing on to discuss how the region \"shows an idealized portrayal of Chinese social relations that exists in localized pockets\". Game Informer characterized the game as an incredible experience, noting that \"[t]he gameplay loop of collection, upgrading, and customization is captivating and compelling\". The execution of gameplay impressed Pocket Gamer, and Destructoid's Chris Carter called the combat system \"one of the most interesting things\" about the game. NPR remarked that the game had an abundance of content despite being free to play, and Forbes commended the game as one that feels coherent and complete. Gene Park of The Washington Post lauded the game as revolutionary for the genre, having players \"imagine a mobile gaming world with titles with quality that matches the industry's top-tier experiences\". Polygon also praised the game for differentiating itself from its peers, heralding its arrival as mobile games become more mainstream and appealing to \"an audience outside the typical mobile gaming demographic\" and \"new players without the hardware to play more conventional and resource-hogging RPGs\".Most of the criticisms about Genshin Impact come from the endgame aspects of the game, Kotaku noting that although the game provides a solid experience it also has \"some of the typical bullshit that comes along with a zero-dollar price tag\". GameSpot echoed this criticism, noting that the game is \"hampered a bit by the restrictions its free-to-play model imposes\". Paul Tassi of Forbes criticized the resin system, noting that to progress past a certain point one must \"spend an absurd amount of money to get around the last few timegates [sic] of the game\". PC Gamer said that playing the endgame becomes \"a slog\", and that the resin system \"feels so unnecessary\". Warning players about how predatory the monetization is, The Washington Post added that such a well-designed game from an aesthetic standpoint can lead some to gamble with the game's gacha system.\n\nAwards\nApple awarded Genshin Impact with \"iPhone Game of the Year\" in the App Store Best of 2020 and the 2021 Apple Design Awards for Visuals and Graphics. The game also won Google Play's \"Best Game of 2020\" and was nominated for \"Users' Choice Game\" at the Best of 2020 awards. At the TapTap Game Awards 2020, the game won \"Game of the Year\". The game was also nominated for Best RPG and Best Mobile Game at The Game Awards 2020, and for Ultimate Game of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards. The game was nominated for Best Ongoing Game and won Best Mobile Game at The Game Awards 2021.\n\nCommercial performance\nOn mobile platforms, Genshin Impact saw 23 million downloads and grossed approximately $60 million within a week after its release. Within two weeks, that figure rose to over $100 million, recouping its development and marketing budget. Its strong performance continued through October 2020 as the game was the highest-grossing game worldwide during that month. Its largest revenue came from China, Japan, South Korea, and the United States, with 69 percent of mobile revenue coming from outside China itself during this time period specifically. In the United States, its release was the largest launch of a role-playing game on mobile in history.On mobile platforms, Genshin Impact had grossed over $393 million within two months after release and over $1 billion by the end of March 2021, the third highest revenue from a mobile game during that time frame after Honor of Kings and PUBG Mobile, making it one of the highest grossing mobile games of all time and the fastest game to reach that milestone on Google Play and the App Store. By October 2021, the game had grossed $2 billion. It became the world's third highest-grossing mobile game of 2021, with $1.9 billion grossed that year. As of December 2021, the game has grossed $3 billion on iOS and Android devices worldwide. The game's largest mobile market is China with 30% of revenue, followed by Japan with 23% and then the United States with 20% of revenue.Across all platforms (including mobile, console and computer platforms), the game is estimated to have grossed nearly $3.7 billion in its first year as of September 2021, the highest ever first-year launch revenue for any video game.\n\nExplanatory notes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nGenshin Impact on Twitter\nGenshin Impact on Sina Weibo (in Chinese) (login required for Firefox users)\nGenshinImpact's channel on YouTube",

Keighley believed part of this was their approach to gamify the show with the interactive winner predictions on their Twitch and Steam broadcasts, which also helped to increase the average length of time viewers watched, from about 25 minutes the previous year to 70 minutes in 2017. Keighley also attributes the higher viewership due to the quality of games that were released in 2017 and nominated, and the anticipation for yet-seen game trailers and new game announcements, though he wants to avoid future shows from being more like E3.One highlight of the ceremony, noted by several outlets, was a rant given by game director Josef Fares while being interviewed on stage by Keighley to discuss his game, A Way Out. Fares, who had a prior history in the film industry before starting video game development, started his rant by saying \"Fuck the Oscars\", before speaking about how the Game Awards ceremony helped to highlight the developers and personalities that were passionate about their work. He also spoke a bit to the then-recent situation around loot boxes and microtransactions related to Electronic Arts' game Star Wars Battlefront II; as Electronic Arts is also the publisher for A Way Out, Fares stated that while \"It's nice to hate EA\", that \"All publishers fuck up sometimes, you know?\", while expressing his appreciate for their support for his game. Fares said in a later interview that he was \"caught up in the moment\", but still believed in the general points he had been trying to make; specifically, Fares indicated that video games as a medium was still seen in its infancy by most other media sources and that the Game Awards was treating the industry with the proper respect.\n\nGame announcements\nIn addition to trailers and presentations for upcoming games and content for current ones, a short teaser for a game by FromSoftware was also shown, later revealed to be Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. The show also included trailers from two films, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle and The Shape of Water. The list of games that were featured included:\n\nAwards\nThe nominees were announced on November 14, 2017. In order to be eligible, candidate games must have had either a commercial or early access release date on or before November 27, 2017. The list of nominees were selected by a panel of 51 people in the video game industry, with the top five games (or six in the case of ties) selected in each category presented as nominees. Public voting for awards ran from November 14 until December 6. Public voting only counted towards 10% of the winners' selection in the jury-voted awards, while it was the sole consideration for the fan's choice awards. At the end of polling, Keighley said that most of the categories had over five million votes each, and there was over eight million voters overall.Two major award changes were made in the Awards structure for the 2017 show. First, the previous \"Best Mobile/Handheld Game\" was split into separate \"Best Mobile Game\" and \"Best Handheld Game\" awards, reflecting the differences in how handheld and mobile games are developed and marketed. Second, a new award for \"Best Ongoing Game\" was offered for games that continue to provide new content as a service model. Another new award, the Student Game Award, was established to highlight games developed by students in higher education programs, and was selected from a panel of five industry leaders: Todd Howard, Hideo Kojima, Ilkka Paananen, Kim Swift, and Vince Zampella.All awards, except for Best Multiplayer, were announced during the December 7 presentation. Keighley reported this was an oversight related to a last-minute change in the trailer material for PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (which had won the award), and confirmed the winner the day after. Winners are listed first and shown in bold.\n\nJury-voted awards\nFan's choice awards\nHonorary awards\nGames with multiple nominations and awards\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website",
    "Hidemaro Fujibayashi": "Hidemaro Fujibayashi (\u85e4\u6797 \u79c0\u9ebf, Fujibayashi Hidemaro, born October 1, 1972) is a Japanese video game designer and director working for Nintendo. He is best known for his contributions to the action-adventure game series The Legend of Zelda, for which he has served as planner, writer and director.\n\nCareer\nBefore he entered the video game industry, Fujibayashi had designed layouts of haunted attractions for Japanese theme parks. At that time, he had considered finding an occupation involving production, and came upon a job opening from a company that developed video games. He was fascinated with the fact that his application for employment had to include a sample of his work that would be inspected directly upon transmittal, and he became enamored with the idea of being a game designer. Fujibayashi eventually joined Capcom in 1995, where he gained experience as planner for the interactive movie Gakk\u014d no Kowai Uwasa: Hanako-san ga Kita!! and the mahjong game Y\u014dsuke Ide Meijin no Shin Jissen Maajan. Later, he became part of the company's Production Studio 1, and designed and directed the puzzle game Magical Tetris Challenge.Fujibayashi's first involvement with the Zelda series was with the Game Boy Color games The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages. In the initial development stages, he acted as sort of a clerk, who gathered all staff ideas and created presentations to propose the game concepts to producer Shigeru Miyamoto. Fujibayashi eventually became the director, participated as planner and scenario writer, and devised a system to link the two games for consecutive playthroughs. During his time at Capcom, he also directed and planned the Game Boy Advance games The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords and The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap. Following his switch to Nintendo, Fujibayashi became subdirector and story writer for the Nintendo DS game The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass. Afterward, he made his directorial debut for a home console Zelda with the Wii game The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. He would later direct the Nintendo Switch and Wii U game The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. According to Fujibayashi, the most important aspect of game design is making the fundamental rule set of a video game absolutely clear to a player. He has a special fondness for the first Legend of Zelda, which he described as \"novel\" and \"groundbreaking\" for its time.\n\nWorks\nReferences\nExternal links\nHidemaro Fujibayashi at MobyGames",
    "Sonic Frontiers": "Sonic Frontiers is an upcoming 2022 platform game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega. It is the first Sonic the Hedgehog game to feature open-world gameplay; as Sonic, the player explores the Starfall Islands, which comprise various biomes.\nDevelopment began after the release of Sonic Forces (2017). Frontiers is scheduled for release on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S in late 2022.\n\nGameplay\nSonic Frontiers is a 3D platformer and action-adventure game, and the first Sonic the Hedgehog game to feature an open world. As Sonic, the player explores the Starfall Islands, which comprise various biomes including flowery fields, forests, ancient ruins, and deserts. Multiple critics compared the open-world design to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017).\n\nDevelopment\nFollowing the release of Sonic Forces (2017), Sonic Team began exploring approaches for its next Sonic the Hedgehog game. In addition to celebrating the series' upcoming 30th anniversary, Sonic Team also sought to define what a modern Sonic game should be and solidify the series' direction for the next decade. Sonic Team head and Sonic series producer Takashi Iizuka wanted the next Sonic game to inform future games, similar to how Sonic Adventure (1998) set a template that following games continued to emulate for 20 years. As such, Sonic Team began developing Frontiers from scratch. The team focused on transitioning Sonic's speed and abilities to the open world while remaining true to previous games.Development was underway by March 2019, and that month Sega opened a fan survey to help determine the series' \"next steps\". Morio Kishimoto, director of Sonic Colors (2010), Lost World (2013), and Forces, returns to direct Frontiers, while Generations (2011) and Forces art director Sachiko Kawamura is producing. Ian Flynn, who wrote Sonic the Hedgehog comics published by Archie Comics and IDW Publishing and episodes of the Sonic Boom TV series, is writing the script, and series composer Jun Senoue is contributing to the score. Sonic Team began regularly holding external playtesting during Frontiers' development.\n\nMarketing and release\nSega unveiled a teaser trailer, featuring Sonic running through a forest, at the end of a 30th anniversary livestream on May 27, 2021. The title was not announced then, but the trailer's metadata and a Sega press release were discovered to have titled the game Sonic Rangers. Iizuka later said that he felt the game was teased prematurely, but believed it was necessary given that it was the 30th anniversary and Sonic Team had not announced a game since Forces' release. Sega trademarked the name Sonic Frontiers in November 2021 and announced it the following month at The Game Awards 2021.Sega planned to release Sonic Frontiers in 2021 to coincide with the franchise's 30th anniversary, but delayed it for a year for quality control. It is scheduled for release in late 2022 for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nOfficial website (in Japanese)",
    "Ganon": "Ganon is a fictional monster and the main antagonist of Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda video game series, as well as the final boss in many Zelda titles. A massive and malevolent creature, he first appeared in the original game, The Legend of Zelda (1986), and has since appeared in the majority of the games in the series. Ganon is the archenemy of the protagonist Link and the leader of the Gerudo, a race of humanoid desert nomads. In his Gerudo form, from which he can transmogrify, he is known as Ganondorf.His specific motives vary from game to game, but most often involve capturing Princess Zelda of Hyrule, the games' usual setting, and planning to conquer Hyrule and the world at large. To this end, he seeks the Triforce, an omnipotent artifact that grants any wish its bearer desires, and usually manipulates several other villains to realize his ambitions. In most games, he possesses the Triforce of Power, which gives him godlike strength, boundless mystical power, and invulnerability to all but the most powerful sacred weapons, such as the Master Sword.\nAs the main villain of the series, Ganon has also appeared in a variety of media and merchandise, including an animated television series, manga and Amiibo. He appears in various spin-off games, such as Hyrule Warriors and Age of Calamity, and also appears in the Super Smash Bros. series.\nThe character has been well received by critics, becoming one of the most popular and recognizable villains in gaming. He has been praised by critics for providing some of the most memorable boss battles in gaming and has been named as one of the greatest video game villains of all time.\n\nConcept and creation\nNames\nGanon was originally known as \"Hakkai\" during development of the original The Legend of Zelda, in reference to a humanoid pig character known as Zhu Bajie (Cho Hakkai in Japanese) from the 16th century Chinese novel Journey to the West. The character is given the name \"Ganondorf Dragmire\" in the English version of the A Link to the Past instruction manual while his monster form's name was \"Mandrag Ganon\". The names \"Dragmire\" and \"Mandrag Ganon\" have not appeared in any of the games or other manuals, though the name \"Ganondorf Dragmire\" is used once on the official Zelda website.Ganon is named inconsistently throughout the series. In the Japanese versions of the first three games, his name is anglicized as \"Gannon\". This spelling appears in two Western releases: the original The Legend of Zelda, and the non-canonical Zelda's Adventure.\n\nCharacter design\nGanon has two basic forms that appear throughout the series: one is a gigantic pig-like form, and the other is his humanoid Gerudo form. In the original The Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past, Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages, Four Swords Adventures, and A Link Between Worlds, he is depicted as a blue, porcine biped wielding either a large sword or a trident. Ocarina of Time marks the first appearance of his humanoid form named Ganondorf, the physically imposing and armor-clad Lord of the Gerudo people. Like all Gerudo, he possesses olive dark skin, amber eyes, and red hair. Ganondorf is around 230 cm and was first drawn with a \"sharp, birdlike nose\" that is characteristic of the Gerudo and \"strong, supple muscles\".For the development of Ocarina of Time, Ganon was conceived by character designer Satoru Takizawa. Takizawa had imagined Ganon as a \"crooked and complex thief, who was basically an all-around abominable human being\". However, script director Toru Osawa claimed that this image was \"not the case\". He began to speak of how Ganondorf was meant to have \"parts where he is rather good\", comparing him to the character of Raoh in Fist of the North Star. With this idea in mind, Takizawa created a tentative model of Ganondorf based on actor Christopher Lambert. The result of Ganondorf was very different from this model, with three forms of the character being created: one of Ganondorf in the beginning; one of Ganondorf seven years later, with longer hair; and one of Ganon in the end. Since Ganon appeared as a boar-like creature, Takizawa decided that Ganondorf should transform into such at the end of the game, despite the opinions of other staff members. He decided on making Ganon a beast \"with the feeling of a pig\" to reference A Link to the Past.In The Wind Waker, Ganondorf appears as an older character to his first appearance in Ocarina of Time. The artists depicted him as middle-aged and created drawings of him \"with an Eastern flavor\". His robe was decorated with patterns that were designed to be a twist on the mark of the Gerudo seen previously. Ganondorf's reappearance in Twilight Princess returned him to a similar age to his original appearance in Ocarina of Time. His design was created to look like a warrior, dressed in armour. He also transforms into Demonic Beast Ganon and this concept art was created with the caption \"Pig Ganon\".In Breath of the Wild, Ganon has three forms. For most of the game he is visible from a distance as a serpentine cloud of Malice\u2014a signature viscous, burning energy that is used to denote his heavy influence\u2014that circles Hyrule Castle. His physical form Calamity Ganon is a grotesque incomplete monster that resembles a spider equipped with various weapons. In the game's final battle he transforms into Dark Beast Ganon, a giant boar-like monster made of Malice. Artist Yuki Hamada commented, \"Dark Beast Ganon takes the shape of a boar like the Ganons of prior games but ended up being very large compared to Link since we wanted the game to end in the vast open plain of Hyrule Field. This might be the biggest Ganon in the history of the series.\" The Phantom Ganons that Link encounters in the Divine Beasts were designed with similar attributes as the manifestations of Ganon, including his red hair, as the artist Takafumi Kiuchi, \"wanted players to feel Ganon's presence at all times\".\n\nPortrayal\nGanon has been voiced by several voice actors. In the 1989 The Legend of Zelda animated television series and Captain N: The Game Master, he was voiced by Len Carlson. In Link: The Faces of Evil and Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon, he was voiced by Mark Berry. For BS Zelda no Densetsu he was voiced by Seiz\u014d Kat\u014d. In the Zelda series and other spin-off games, the character has been voiced by several Japanese voice actors, including Takashi Nagasako in Ocarina of Time, The Wind Waker, Super Smash Bros. Melee and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate; Hironori Miyata in Twilight Princess, Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U; and Taiten Kusunoki in Hyrule Warriors.\n\nCharacteristics\nGanon is the main antagonist in The Legend of Zelda series and is presented as the embodiment of evil. He usually appears as the final boss at the end of each game. A recurring storyline in the series centres around the protagonist Link fighting to save Princess Zelda after she is captured by Ganon. Over the course of the series, Ganon has been depicted in various physical forms. As the human form known as Ganondorf, he is the king and the only male member of the Gerudo. He bears the physical traits of the Gerudo race, having red hair, dark skin and pointy ears. He also often transforms into a monstrous beast resembling a giant boar with glowing eyes. Ganon has been given various titles over the series, including \"King of Evil\", \"King of Thieves\", \"the Dark Lord\", \"King of Darkness\" and \"Prince of Darkness\".As the embodiment of evil, the character's presence spreads darkness and wards off good magic, a characteristic which is affirmed by the fairy Navi in Ocarina of Time. Ganon is consumed and powered by his malice and hatred. In Skyward Sword, he is revealed as the manifestation of the antagonist Demon King Demise's hatred following the character's defeat. The game was presented as the start of the fictional Zelda timeline in which Ganon is destined to forever return in an endless battle with Link and Zelda. In Twilight Princess, he is shown to absorb the resentment and anger of other characters and uses it to become more powerful. In the final boss battle in Breath of the Wild, he transforms into Dark Beast Ganon and is described as \"Hatred and Malice Incarnate\".The character's motivations typically centre around destroying Hyrule or placing himself in a position of power as ruler. His destructive influence is particularly illustrated in Ocarina of Time, when Link awakens from a seven-year sleep to discover Hyrule transformed following Ganondorf's rise to power. In place of the former peaceful kingdom, Hyrule becomes a place of fear shrouded in darkness and populated by monsters and ReDead zombies.In the lore of the series, Ganon is the bearer of the Triforce of Power, a divine symbol and one of three components that form the Triforce. It bestows \"true power\" onto its wielder, making him physically strong and powerful in the use of magic. The position of the Triforce of Power at the top of the Triforce places him in direct opposition to Link and Zelda as bearers of the Triforce of Courage and Wisdom respectively. A recurring plot element in the series is Ganon's desire to obtain the completed Triforce, which offers limitless power to its bearer. This struggle for control of the Triforce has been a central aspect of several games, such as Ocarina of Time, and binds the three main characters in an eternal battle across the fictional Zelda timeline.\n\nPowers and abilities\nAs the final boss in the games, Ganon/Ganondorf is presented as a dangerous foe who is difficult to defeat. He is a formidable warrior and sorcerer, and he is skilled enough a swordsman to combat Link. He is capable of dual-wielding large blades, such as great swords. He also possesses great physical strength, which can be seen in Ocarina of Time, where he destroys Hyrule Castle with one punch. In Twilight Princess, the character displays invincibility when he is sentenced to execution for attempting to conquer Hyrule but the Sages are unable to take his life. He is typically only defeated by Link with the use of a legendary weapon like the Master Sword or Light Arrows. Due to his near-immortality and indestructible power, he often needs to be sealed away in another realm by magic to prevent him from causing more destruction. However, the character is always reincarnated in a subsequent game, which emphasises his immortality.Over the course of the Zelda series, Ganon/Ganondorf has demonstrated various magical powers and abilities. These powers originate in his use of dark magic and have varied across the game series. He can use various defensive measures in combat, such as using dark magic to create magical barriers. In the original The Legend of Zelda game he is able to turn himself invisible and uses his magic to propel fireballs at Link. In several games, such as Ocarina of Time, he is able to create shadow clones of himself that possess his skills and abilities but are immune to damage. Ganondorf also has the ability of teleportation, giving him the advantage of sneaking behind his opponent in combat in Twilight Princess. In Ocarina of Time he has the ability to levitate. He has also demonstrated that he can pass between dimensions, such as the Dark World and the Twilight Realm.Ganon has the power to possess and control other characters. This is particularly evident in Twilight Princess, where he possesses Princess Zelda and uses her body like a puppet to fight against Link. He can also manipulate other characters for his own benefit, including Zant in Twilight Princess and Agahnim in A Link to the Past. In Breath of the Wild, Calamity Ganon is able to corrupt creatures with the spread of a substance called Malice. This gives him the ability to take control of monsters and the ancient technology that was originally under the control of Hyrule, such as the Guardians.\n\nAppearances\nThe Legend of Zelda series\nGanon made his first appearance in the original 1986 NES video game The Legend of Zelda, in the form of a blue monstrous pig named \"Gannon\". The first game in the series established the character's desire for power, which was reiterated in subsequent games. The storyline involves the character invading Hyrule with his army and stealing the Triforce of Power. To prevent him from obtaining the Triforce of Wisdom, Princess Zelda scatters the eight pieces across the kingdom. Link is then sent on a quest to retrieve the eight fragments and finally defeats Gannon using a silver arrow.In 1987, the second entry in the Zelda series was released, titled Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, but the game did not feature the physical presence of Ganon. However, his image appears in the final game over screen, signifying the return of Ganon.The character's next appearance was in the 1991 Super Nintendo Entertainment System game A Link to the Past. The game expands on Ganon's backstory by revealing that he used to be a man named Ganondorf, the leader of a group of thieves who manage to enter the Sacred Realm and steal the Triforce, which plunges the Sacred Realm into darkness. Ganon is already sealed in this Dark World when Link and Zelda are sent there by the wizard Agahnim. After Link defeats Agahnim's avatar in the Dark World, Ganon rises from his body and turns into a bat. At the Pyramid of Power, Link finally defeats Ganon in his beast form in order to restore Hyrule and the Sacred Realm.In the 1993 game Link's Awakening, the fourth Shadow Nightmare that Link must face in the final boss battle is based on Ganon from A Link to the Past. During the battle, the Shadow of Ganon shoots bats made from fire and throws a spinning trident at Link.The 1998 game Ocarina of Time, which was released for the Nintendo 64, introduced the character in his humanoid form as Ganondorf, the king of the Gerudo thieves. In the chronology of the series, it is his earliest appearance, expanding upon the backstory first introduced in A Link to the Past. In the story, Ganondorf schemes to take the Triforce in order to conquer Hyrule. After pulling the Master Sword from its pedestal and being put into a seven-year sleep, Link wakes as an adult to discover that Ganondorf is now ruling over Hyrule. Ganondorf successfully stole the Triforce from the Sacred Realm but his evil heart broke it into three pieces, with Ganondorf keeping the Triforce of Power. In the final boss fight, Link and Ganondorf battle at Ganon's Castle, but after Ganondorf's defeat, he transforms into his beast form Ganon. He is finally defeated by Link before being sealed away in the Dark Realm by the Sages.In 2001, Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages were released for the Game Boy Color handheld console. The two games feature their own antagonists, but upon completing either game, the player receives a password that provides access to a linked game in the opposite title. The linked game reveals Ganon as the secret final boss, who was resurrected by two witches named Twinrova.Ganon appears in the 2002 GameCube game The Wind Waker, resuming his plans to obtain the complete Triforce and conquer Hyrule. In the backstory of the game, the goddesses flood Hyrule to prevent Ganon from gaining power. Although he does not at first appear as the main villain, he is revealed to be the master of the Helmaroc King. He kidnaps Zelda, in her guise of Tetra, to complete the Triforce and gain ultimate power over Hyrule. His plans ultimately fail and in the final boss battle, Link defeats Ganondorf by thrusting the Master Sword into his forehead, turning him to stone.In the 2004 GameCube game Four Sword's Adventures, the antagonists are initially shown to be Shadow Link and Vaati. However, Ganon is revealed to be the true villain who stole a powerful magical trident and Dark Mirror to create the evil version of Link. Ganon uses Shadow Link to kidnap the shrine maidens of Hyrule and murders the Knights of Hyrule, trapping them in the World of Darkness. Link with his clones frees the shrine maidens and seals Ganon inside the Four Sword to return peace to Hyrule.In Twilight Princess, which was released in 2006 for the Wii and GameCube, Ganondorf is the catalyst to the game's events, allying himself with Zant to take over Hyrule. In the game's backstory, the Sages banish Ganon with the Mirror of Twilight after he tried to steal the Triforce. After Link and his companion Midna defeat Zant, they face Ganondorf for the final battle at Hyrule Castle. Ganondorf battles Link by possessing Zelda and using her like a puppet and afterwards transforms into his beast form. After Link slays Ganon, Midna safely transports Link and Zelda to Hyrule field, but Link is forced to again face Ganondorf in his human form. Ganondorf is defeated by Link with the help of Zelda's Light Arrows when Link finally plunges the Master Sword into Ganondorf's chest.In the 2007 Nintendo DS game Phantom Hourglass, which is a direct sequel to The Wind Waker, Ganondorf only appears in a cameo in the opening sequence that summarizes the plot of the latter game.Ganon does not appear in the 2011 Wii game Skyward Sword as he was replaced by a new antagonist named Lord Ghirahim. Talking to Nintendo Power, Eiji Aonuma explained that he wanted a different kind of antagonist and that Ghirahim was created to contrast with Ganon's \"very masculine, powerful, evil\" image. Despite his absence, the game suggests that Ganon is the manifestation of the game's demonic god named Demise when Link's companion Fi says that Demise is \"the source of all monsters\". Demise's final curse also establishes that Ganon, Link and Zelda are placed in an eternal cycle of conflict.In the 2013 Nintendo 3DS game A Link Between Worlds, Ganon, in his original form, makes a minor appearance, though his past actions and influence greatly affect the course of events throughout the story and serves as the inspiration for Yuga. Yuga summons him back from his seal with the power of the seven sages, previously trapped within paintings by Yuga, and fuses with Ganon to become Yuga Ganon, but is defeated by Link.\n\nThe character appears in Breath of the Wild, released in 2017 for Nintendo Switch and Wii U, as a malevolent force called Calamity Ganon. In the backstory, he returns from an earlier defeat to take control of an army of Guardian robots, which he uses against the Hyruleans with the aim of destroying Hyrule. Using his Blight Ganon doppelg\u00e4ngers he murders the four Champions to take control of the powerful ancient technology that they piloted known as the four Divine Beasts. Hyrule is consequently reduced to a wasteland inhabited by roaming monsters. Link is  severely injured during a subsequent battle with the Guardian robots in an effort to protect Princess Zelda and is placed into a hundred-year-long slumber to heal, before Zelda awakens him to destroy Ganon.\n\nOther video games\nGanon makes an appearance in the 1992 Zelda no Densetsu: Kamigami no Triforce (Barcode Battler II). The game was released by Epoch Co. and involves scanning barcodes to battle enemies on cards with a story based on A Link to the Past.Ganon appears in his \"demon boar\" form in two of the three CD-i Zelda titles: Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon and Link: The Faces of Evil. The games centre on Ganon attacking Gamelon and the island of Koridai. In Zelda's Adventure, Ganon takes over the kingdom of Tolemac and captures Link.Ganondorf made his first appearance in the Super Smash Bros. series in his Ocarina of Time design as an unlockable character in Super Smash Bros. Melee. He reappears in all subsequent installments, including Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. In Super Smash Bros. Melee, Ganondorf's moveset was a slower, stronger version of Captain Falcon's and his Warlock Punch was based on the Falcon Punch. For Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Eiji Aonuma said that his design team submitted designs to the developers for Ganondorf based on Twilight Princess. Ganondorf appears in the single-player The Subspace Emissary mode, allied with Bowser and Wario. His final smash is his \"Dark Beast Ganon\" form from Twilight Princess, in which he transforms, charges across the screen and then warps himself back onto the stage. Ganondorf was also included as an unlockable character in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, which features a similar moveset but introduces the use of a sword in place of his Warlock Punch. In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Ganondorf's design matches his Ocarina of Time appearance and he uses his sword in certain attacks. He has several special moves, including transforming into Demon King Ganon for his final smash.Ganondorf appears as a playable character in the Zelda spin-off title Hyrule Warriors. He features alongside various other characters from the Zelda series, including villains Ghirahim from Skyward Sword and Zant from Twilight Princess. He can also be customised with several outfits, including his Demon King costume set.Ganon can be summoned into a player's village in Animal Crossing: New Leaf by scanning a compatible amiibo that was released for the 30th anniversary of The Legend of Zelda series. Ganondorf is available as an unlockable \"Mystery Mushroom\" costume in Super Mario Maker. He is also playable in the Nintendo Switch version of Diablo III: Eternal Collection, with the Switch version of the game exclusively offering amiibo support and additional content based on The Legend of Zelda series. Ganon also makes a cameo appearance alongside Link in Scribblenauts Unlimited.Ganon is the final boss in the 2019 Nintendo Switch rhythm game Cadence of Hyrule. The storyline involves Link, Zelda and Cadence searching for four magic instruments to defeat Ganon.Calamity Ganon appears in the 2020 hack and slash video game Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity. In addition to being the main antagonist of the game, he can also be unlocked as a playable character at the end of the game after the player completes all of the challenges.In 2021, Nintendo released Game & Watch: The Legend of Zelda, a handheld unit that incorporates three games, The Legend of Zelda, The Adventure of Link and Link's Awakening. The unit celebrates 35 years of The Legend of Zelda series and revisits Link's first battle with Ganon in the original game.\n\nTelevision series\nGanon appears as the main villain of the 1989 The Legend of Zelda cartoon, which was shown as part of The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! in syndication that year. In the cartoon, Ganon is a brown-skinned anthropomorphic boar and wizard with a squeally voice. He is in possession of the Triforce of Power and spends each episode plotting to steal the Triforce of Wisdom and take over Hyrule. However, his plan is usually thwarted by Link and Zelda by the end of the episode. With powerful magical abilities and a quick temper, Ganon is depicted as a menacing character who will do whatever is necessary, including sacrificing his minions, in order to win his victory. He was voiced by Len Carlson.In addition to the Zelda cartoon, Ganon (along with Link and Zelda) also appeared in Captain N: The Game Master, as a secondary villain in the episode \"Quest for the Potion of Power\". During the episode, Ganon is revived, double-crosses Mother Brain, and is killed by the reflected magic on Link's shield.In the South Park episode \"Imaginationland Episode III\", Ganondorf makes an appearance in his Ocarina of Time incarnation as one of many evil characters battling the good characters.\n\nComics and manga\nThe Legend of Zelda comic series published in the 1990s by Valiant Comics was based on The Legend of Zelda games and featured Ganon as an antagonist in the stories and bonus stories.Ganon has appeared in The Legend of Zelda manga.

In 2008, GameDaily ranked him the second on their lists of \"Top Ten Nintendo Characters That Deserve Their Own Games\" list and in 2009 as the \"Most Persistent Video Game Villains of All Time\". GamesRadar listed him second on their 2009 list of \"The Top Video Game Villains who will Never Stay Dead\". IGN listed Ganon as one of the \"Top 10 Characters In Need of a Spin-Off\" and ranked him third on its \"Top 100 Videogames Villains\" list. GameSpot also included him in its \"Top Ten Video Game Villains\". Jeff Mills for The Escapist included Ganon on a 2017 list of \"8 of the Strongest Video Game Villains of All Time\" commenting, \"The possessor of the Triforce of Power, he has astonishing magical and physical powers, including what seems to be near-immortality. Ganon tends to be portrayed as the personification of evil, as opposed to Link, who personifies benevolence.\" In 2021, Melody Macready of Screen Rant opined that Dark Lord Ganondorf in Twilight Princess is the best incarnation of the character and commented, \"He was darker, more menacing than ever, had no problem slaughtering innocents, and Nintendo didn't shy away from his brutality.\" Matt Kamen for Wired responded positively to the presence of Calamity Ganon in Breath of the Wild by stating, \"Ganon is the de facto supervillain of the Zelda series, but he's never been so threatening as he is here. He's seen in the distance from almost any high point, a towering dragon of roiling dark energy, coiled ominously around Hyrule Castle.\"The boss fights between Link and Ganon have been the subject of critical commentary. In 2004, GameSpot counted his appearance in Ocarina of Time among the \"Top Ten Boss Fights\", commenting, \"Ganon is one of the most classic and memorable bosses ever to rule a video game, and the Ocarina of Time fight with him is his most amazing appearance yet\". In 2012, Mark Langshaw of Digital Spy also considered the final battle against Ganon/Ganondorf in Ocarina of Time to be one of the most memorable boss battles, commenting that, \"the dual contest against Ganondorf and his monstrous alter ego was a fitting end to an epic adventure.\" Chris Freiburg for Den of Geek also chose Ganon in Ocarina of Time as the best boss fight, describing him as \"a towering pig beast wielding two massive swords in an arena surrounded by a ring of fire\" and opined, \"it\u2019s hard not to consider it the best boss fight in franchise history.\" In 2017, Brian Shea writing for Game Informer ranked all the appearances of Ganon and chose his battle with Link in The Wind Waker as the greatest moment, commenting that the final blow in the scene, \"is in stark contrast to the cute cel-shaded visual style in the best way possible\" and \"delivers players one of the most memorable final sequences in gaming.\" In 2021, Marco Vito Oddo writing for Collider ranked every appearance of Ganon and considered the final boss battle in The Wind Waker as the best Ganondorf duel in The Legend of Zelda franchise. By contrast, he considered the final boss battle in Breath of the Wild to be \"utterly disappointing\", describing Calamity Ganon as \"another giant blob of dark energy that fights just like every other Ganon Blight the player already fought and defeated\" and \"an unsatisfactory ending to a fantastic game.\" Gaming Bolt named Dark Beast Ganon as one of \"13 Badass Looking Bosses That Were Ultimately Pushovers\" stating, \"The fight against Calamity Ganon is disappointingly easy as it is, but then you take on his second form, Dark Beast Ganon, which turns out to be even more of a cakewalk. Given how menacing the devilish creature looks, you wouldn\u2019t expect him to go down this easily.\"Critics have also commented on Ganon's appearance in the Super Smash Bros. series. Jeremy Parish of Polygon ranked 73 fighters from Super Smash Bros. Ultimate \"from garbage to glorious\", placing Ganon at 33rd, and stated that, \"Yes, Ganon looked cool and scary in Ocarina of Time, but he's more or less become a swarthier version of Mega Man's Dr. Wily: A villain so overplayed he's become practically comical.\" Gavin Jasper of Den of Geek ranked Ganon as 54th on his list of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate characters, stating, \"Ganondorf is a great villain and all, but his Gerudo form mainly exists for the build-up until it's time for him to hit his Ganon form so that the true battle can begin. He\u2026remains his lesser form, only becoming Ganon for his Final Smash or for a specific boss fight.\"\n\nLegacy\nGanon is one of the most recognizable and popular villains in gaming and has been met with positive reception over the years. As the main villain of the series, his image has been recreated in various forms of fan art. He is also a popular character with fans for cosplay. The character has also appeared in various Zelda merchandise, including collectible figurines and Amiibo.In 2010, Nintendo Power named him the best villain in Nintendo history. In 2013, Ganon was chosen as the fourth greatest videogame villain of all time in a poll for Guinness World Records 2013 Gamer\u2019s Edition. GamesRadar ranked him in 2013 as the best villain in the history of video games. In 2018, GamesRadar staff described Ganon as the fourth best villain in video games, stating, \"Ganon isn't meant to be a single, defined character. Ganon is evil. Like evil in our own world, Ganon can never be completely contained or eliminated. He'll always appear again in a new form suited to subverting the peaceful ways that arise in his temporary absence.\"\n\nSee also\nCharacters of The Legend of Zelda\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nGanon at Zelda.com",
    "Cemu": "Cemu is a closed-source Wii U video game console emulator developed by Exzap who serves as the core and GPU developer, and Petergov as the core and audio emulation developer. It was initially released on October 13, 2015 for Microsoft Windows. Typically, the emulator updates once every two to four weeks, with Patreon supporters receiving updates a week before the public release. Though it is still under development, it is able to run certain games smoothly. It was successful at booting and running The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild soon after its release.\n\nDevelopment\nDesigned as a proof-of-concept, the initial release of Cemu could successfully boot Mario Kart 8 and The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD yet lacked Wii U GamePad support and audio and suffered from stutters and video glitches. Cemu could run on 64-bit Windows operating systems and only supported OpenGL 3.3 on release. Despite the Wii U sharing a similar name as its predecessor, the Wii, the emulator was built independently from Dolphin, a Wii emulator, as the systems only shared their CPU architecture in common. The emulator would rapidly progress from this state and increase its compatibility with the Wii U game library and add more features.\nA couple of days after The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild released, Cemu was able to boot the game though running at a sluggish framerate, without audio, and filled with many glitches. The anticipation for emulation of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild caused the emulator's Patreon to increase monthly donations to $7,400 per month and later $22,317 per month. Developers of Cemu expected that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild would be playable with only a few months worth of work, and had a rudimentary version of the game's tutorial playable within weeks of its release. Cutscenes were made available with a community-made add-on called Cemuhook though Cemu 1.18.0 removed the need for the plugin.\n\nReception\nThe emulator has received positive reception on its ability to play Wii U games on PC at higher resolutions than 1080p, the base resolution of the console, via the usage of graphics packs. Notable games running at higher resolutions include Mario Kart 8 running in 8K resolution and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild in 4K resolution. Many mods and enhancements have been developed for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. In August 2017, a hack to Cemu Emulator developed by Cemu community member Xalphenos allowed The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild to run at 60 frames per second (FPS), higher than the game's native 30 FPS limit.Unlike other emulators, Cemu is notably not open source. Exzap explained that it allows for quick progress and for more control of its development. However, the decision drew criticism from other emulation developers. Higan creator Byuu, later known as Near, condemned the Cemu's closed-source nature, arguing that Cemu benefitted from the work of previous emulators without contributing back. Pierre Bourdon, a Dolphin developer, also disagreed with its commercial status, expressing concern that high paying donors could influence the emulator's development team to favour certain bug fixes or games to support. In January 2022, Exzap revealed Cemu's roadmap, stating that Cemu is planned to go open source in 2022, noting that there is not currently a more precise ETA for this.\n\nSee also\nCitra, the first Nintendo 3DS emulator\nYuzu, popular Nintendo Switch emulator\nList of video game console emulators\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website",
    "Master Sword": "The Master Sword (\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30bd\u30fc\u30c9, Masut\u0101 S\u014ddo) is a fictional divine magic sword in Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda series. It is also known as \"The Blade of Evil's Bane\", the \"Sword of Resurrection\", the \"Sword that Seals the Darkness\", and the \"Sacred Sword\". It was introduced in the 1991 action-adventure video game The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and has since appeared in numerous other games in The Legend of Zelda series. The sword is the signature weapon of the hero, Link and has become an integral part of the character's visual identity and destiny in Zelda mythology. In the narrative of the Zelda series, it is a powerful, sacred weapon that Link repeatedly uses to defeat the main antagonist, Ganon and other forces of evil. Throughout the Zelda series, it is shown to have various magical powers, including the capability to repel evil, alter the flow of time and emit light beams to attack surrounding enemies. In addition to The Legend of Zelda series, the Master Sword has also appeared in various other video games, media and merchandise, including Super Smash Bros., Mario Kart 8 and Hyrule Warriors. It has been recreated in fan art, cosplay and weaponry and has become a widely recognisable image in video gaming.\n\nCharacteristics\nThe Master Sword is a divine, magic sword and the signature weapon of Link, the hero of The Legend of Zelda series. It has become a defining aspect of Link's identity alongside the Hylian Shield. The majority of The Legend of Zelda video games follow a similar story arc that involves Link starting the game with a simple weapon and embarking on a journey that eventually leads him to recovering the Master Sword. Once he obtains it, the sword makes Link much stronger in combat so that the player has greater capability to defeat the main antagonist at the end of the game.The Master Sword has been referred to by various names over the course of The Legend of Zelda series. In several games it is named the \"Blade of Evil's Bane\". In The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, the Master Sword is described as, \"The legendary sword that seals the darkness.\" It is also named the \"Master Sword of Resurrection\". In Hyrule Warriors it is called \"The Sacred Sword\". In the mythology of the series, the Master Sword is defined as a divine object. In The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword, it originates in the Goddess Sword, created by the goddess Hylia. Over the course of the game, the Goddess Sword is transformed into the Master Sword, a powerful blade that has the magical ability to repel evil. As the goddess' chosen hero, Link repeatedly wields the sword in various titles to defeat Ganon (sometimes named Ganondorf), the main antagonist of the series, making it an integral aspect of the battle between good and evil. A recurring plot element is that the blade is traditionally found in its stone pedestal and must be pulled from the pedestal by Link to retrieve it. Although it is not always the strongest sword in Zelda games, the Master Sword is superior to other in-game weapons as it is the only weapon in most games that has the capability of defeating Ganon.Since its first appearance in The Legend of Zelda series, there have been several versions of the Master Sword. The design of the sword has evolved over the course of each Zelda title, but it has become identifiable by its purple and silver design. In its first appearance in the 1991 action-adventure video game The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, the Master Sword is a simple fantasy sword with a generic design. This early depiction evolved over subsequent years to transform into its contemporary design, which is a one-handed longsword blade featuring a blue or purple hilt with green grip, purple spread-winged handguards and a yellow gem inlaid in the centre.A defining feature of the sword is that it displays the Triforce, which is engraved on the blade just above the ricasso.The sword possesses various magical abilities that can be used by Link during gameplay, such as creating fire attacks and lightning attacks in The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. In The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, the sword works as a seal that protects the Sacred Realm and the Triforce. It can also alter time by placing it in its pedestal to send Link back to his childhood or by removing it again to travel to the future. In The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker the sword blocks the powers of Ganondorf and freezes time around Hyrule Castle, so that removing the blade from its pedestal restores Ganondorf's minions. In The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess Link uses it to open a path in time. In The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword it can be pointed towards the sky to gather energy from the heavens and launch a light beam known as a Skyward Strike. In The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, the Master Sword is the only weapon that can break the magical barrier that is placed on Hyrule Castle. In Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity it emits light beams that deal high damage to surrounding enemies. In Breath of the Wild its superior qualities are indicated by its high durability, as it is the only weapon that is unbreakable and must be recharged before being wielded again. When in close proximity to enemies associated with Calamity Ganon, the Master Sword also glows blue and doubles its attack strength.Throughout The Legend of Zelda series, the Master Sword has a unique relationship with its destined bearer, Link. This is summarised in a Breath of the Wild cutscene by Zelda.\nWhether skyward bound, adrift in time, or steeped in the glowing embers of twilight... the sacred blade is forever bound to the soul of the Hero.\nIn the mythology of the series, the Master Sword is created to be wielded by the chosen hero and chooses its own master. According to its fictional legend only someone pure of heart can draw the sword from its pedestal. Before he is able to claim it, Link must undergo various tests in order to prove himself worthy. In Skyward Sword, it is Link himself who transforms the Goddess Sword into the Master Sword, which reinforces his connection to it. A humanoid spirit named Fi is chosen by the goddess Hylia to act as a guide to Link. Her spirit resides in the Goddess Sword and by the end of the game she bids farewell to Link to sleep forever within the Master Sword. Throughout other Zelda titles, the Master Sword lies dormant in its pedestal to await the reincarnated hero, Link who is destined to save Hyrule from evil.\n\nDevelopment\nThe Master Sword was first introduced to the series in the third entry, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. The French version of the game called it Excalibur, which originated from Arthurian Legend in the Welsh collection of Mabinogion. Subsequent entries continued to refer to it as Excalibur in the French versions of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess.In 2011, Nintendo released a video game titled The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword, which aimed to develop an early history of the fictional kingdom of Hyrule and create an origin story for the Master Sword. Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma commented that the game's premise was based on a desire to focus the story on the gameplay experience, which was built around the game's motion controls. He said, \"This time, the theme is the sword which makes use of the Wii MotionPlus accessory... When you think of a sword in The Legend of Zelda, you think of the Master Sword. Rather early on, we decided to address the origin of the Master Sword.\" The story concept placed the sword at the centre of Zelda lore, but as it was not the first video game released in the series, the plot suffered from inconsistencies in relation to the pre-existing timeline. Skyward Sword director Hidemaro Fujibayashi explained, \"We settled on having the sky and surface world, and on top of that, it was going to tell the story of the creation of Hyrule, with the untold story of the origin of the Master Sword... So, looking back at the series so far, we began knitting together the various elements. And then all sorts of contradictions arose.\" Despite these inconsistencies, the storyline established the Master Sword as a defining element of the narrative. The plot centres around Link transforming the weapon into the Master Sword. It gives Link the power to defeat the antagonist Demon King Demise by trapping his essence inside the sword. This storyline was the foundation for the lore of every other title in The Legend of Zelda series, with the Master Sword placed at the heart of its mythology. The sword was also used as the central game mechanic for the Wii version of Skyward Sword. A television commercial for the game's release in 2011 prominently featured the Master Sword as a way to connect the player to the game's motion controls, which involved using the Wii MotionPlus to control the sword's movements on screen.\n\nAppearances\nThe Legend of Zelda series\nIn the original 1986 The Legend of Zelda video game, a sword appears that predates the Master Sword. This early image of a sword is depicted as a standard fantasy weapon without any defining features, but as an early example, it was the precursor for future iterations of the Master Sword that would appear in subsequent titles. Over the course of the Zelda series, the Master Sword reappeared with each incarnation of Link and its design was changed over time to suit the character's appearance in each era.The Master Sword was introduced in 1991 with the release of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, which was the third game in The Legend of Zelda series. The storyline involves Link setting out to rescue Princess Zelda by retrieving the blade from its pedestal in the Lost Woods and using it to defeat the main antagonists, the evil wizard Agahnim and finally, Ganon. Several concepts that originated in the game were repeated in subsequent games in the series, including Link drawing the sword from its pedestal and the sword being the only weapon capable of defeating Ganon. The game also gives Link the ability to upgrade the Master Sword firstly into the Tempered Sword and secondly into the Golden Sword to give it a stronger attack power. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Instruction Manual states that the player's first goal is to claim the Master Sword and explains that before he can wield it, Link must obtain three pendants representing courage, wisdom and power by defeating the masters of three dungeons. Once he has obtained the Master Sword, Link must head to the castle to do battle with Agahnim. However before Link defeats Agahnim, he is sent to the Dark World, a gloomy version of Hyrule. Link must then rescue the seven descendants of the Seven Sages and harness their combined power before he can defeat Ganon.In 1998 the Master Sword reappeared in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and was the first iteration of the longsword design in 3D. The sword is again presented as the only weapon that is capable of defeating Ganon and is this time located in the Temple of Time, locked behind the Door of Time. It also acts as a gateway between Hyrule and the Sacred Realm. After Link has collected three Spiritual Stones he is able to open the Door of Time and claim the Master Sword from its pedestal. Due to his youth the sword seals Link in the Temple of Time for seven years until he is ready to be the Hero of Time. When Link journeys around Hyrule to awaken five of the Seven Sages, he can use the Master Sword to travel back in time by placing it in the pedestal.A simpler version of the Master Sword appears in the 2001 game duo The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages. The trademark features of the sword are not easily identified in these games due to the simplified in-game sprites. In the Oracle games, the Master Sword appears as a blue pixel sword. It diverges from the typical traits seen in other versions of the Master Sword, as it is found in a different location to the rest of the Zelda timeline and is breakable.In The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker (2002) the Master Sword appears with a slightly different shape and design. In this storyline, Link finds the Master Sword inside the sunken Hyrule Castle. The sword blocks Ganondorf's magical powers and freezes time around the castle. When the blade is removed from its pedestal, it restores the life of Ganondorf's minions. Ganondorf's magic is also restored and the Master Sword loses its power to repel evil. The game involves Link seeking out two new sages to replenish the fading power of the sword. Once its magic has been restored, Link can destroy a magic barrier to Ganon's Tower. Eventually, Link destroys Ganondorf by plunging the Master Sword into his forehead and turning him to stone.The Master Sword appears again in The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (2006). In the storyline, Link must seek out its resting place deep in Faron Woods in the Sacred Grove, where the pedestal is located in the ruined Temple of Time. Link must retrieve the sword as it is the only way to break the magic of Zant, which has turned him into a wolf. When Link returns to the Sacred Grove, he uses the sword to open a path to a time before the Temple of Time was ruined. The sword is upgraded by infusing it with the light of the Sols, which makes it powerful against twilit creatures and gives it the ability to clear Dark Fog. At the end of the game the Master Sword is finally used to kill Ganondorf.In The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword (2011), the Master Sword plays a central role in Link's journey to defeat the main antagonist, Demon King Demise and prove himself as the hero. The plot charts the weapon's transition from the Goddess Sword into the Master Sword. Link descends to the surface from Skyloft to obtain the Triforce and defeat Demon King Demise. He uses three Sacred Flames to transform the Goddess Sword into the Master Sword and then seals Demise inside the sword by placing it on its pedestal, which causes Demise to vow revenge. In Zelda story chronology, this act is the beginning of the endless cycle that places Zelda and Link in opposition to Ganon in all other Zelda titles. Following this, the humans are free to descend to the surface and establish the kingdom of Hyrule.In The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds (2013), which is a successor to A Link to the Past, Link must retrieve the Master Sword from its pedestal in the Lost Woods after collecting three Pendants of Virtue. He must then rescue the Seven Sages and Princess Zelda, before saving Hyrule from Ganon. In the process, Link pursues the evil sorcerer Yuga, who transforms his victims into paintings. He meets Princess Hilda in the kingdom of Lorule, who informs him that the power of the Triforce almost destroyed her kingdom. Hilda and Yuga make a plan together to steal the Triforce from Hyrule and resurrect Ganon. During the game, the Master Sword is upgraded by blacksmiths in Hyrule and Lorule after Link collects master ore from various locations, making it a more powerful weapon.The Master Sword makes a prominent appearance in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017). As Link travels through Hyrule, he has the option of obtaining the sword once he is strong enough to pull it from its stone. In the storyline, Link must travel to Korok Forest and speak with the Great Deku Tree to retrieve the sword from the location where Zelda has left it for safe keeping. It appears heavily damaged and covered in Malice after being used in battle against Calamity Ganon 100 years before the events of the game. After successfully retrieving the Master Sword, the player is given the opportunity to tackle one of the end game challenges named \"The Trial of the Sword\", which is aimed at advanced players. Upon successfully completing all of the levels, the player is bestowed with the additional advantage of the Master Sword being indefinitely powered up, so that it does not need to be recharged.The Master Sword will appear in the upcoming sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which is due to be released in 2023. One teaser footage shows Link holding the Master Sword, which appears heavily damaged or corrupted.\n\nOther media\nThe Master Sword has made appearances in various other video games. Link appears with the Master Sword as a playable character in the original 1999 Super Smash Bros. In Super Smash Bros Ultimate, Link also appears as a playable character in eight different costumes that include the Master Sword and Hylian Shield. The Master Sword has also made an appearance in Animal Crossing games and Soulcaliber II. In Nintendo Land, players can wield the Master Sword as part of The Legend of Zelda: Battle Quest. Link makes a cameo appearance with the Master Sword and the Hylian Shield in Scribblenauts Unlimited. In Bayonetta 2, Bayonetta is able to use the Master Sword after equipping Link's costume. In the racing game Mario Kart 8, the Master Sword was introduced with Link in the first DLC. It also makes an appearance in the Hyrule Circuit as a statue inside the castle. It is also obtainable as gear alongside the Hylian Shield in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.  The Master Sword was also introduced in Super Mario Maker 2 with a Zelda update in 2019. The sword transforms Mario into Link and bestows a range of special abilities.In the hack and slash video game Hyrule Warriors (2014), the Master Sword appears as a prominent weapon. Link can use it in battle alongside the Hylian Shield, and after completing certain tasks, the sword has the capability of emitting the sword beam. The storyline centres on Link and his allies battling against the antagonist Cia and various other villains.In Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity (2020), Link is able to use the Master Sword throughout the game after defeating an antagonist named Astor and retrieving the blade from its pedestal. Once obtained, Link is able to power up the sword by fusing other weapons into it. The fully maxed out Master Sword then unlocks an additional attack called the Sword Beam that attacks enemies from a distance.The Master Sword has also been featured prominently in Zelda-related media, including books and other merchandise.\n\nReception\nSince its introduction in The Legend of Zelda series, the Master Sword has become a recognisable image in video gaming. Due to its popularity, the sword has been the subject of various works of fan art. It has been recreated in the form of fan-made replicas and also as a functioning weapon.Over the course of the series, the sword has become an integral aspect of Link's identity, both visually and in terms of the character's development. It has been recreated by fans alongside the Hylian Shield as part of Link's signature costume for cosplay. Nintendo Power listed the Master Sword as one of the best weapons in gaming, citing that it is more than just a powerful sword, but also integral to Link's adventures and development as a character. Writing for Paste, Khee Hoon Chan commented on the significance of the Master Sword in the narrative of the Zelda storyline, stating, \"There are few scenes in entertainment as iconic as the image of young Link pulling the Master Sword from its pedestal, a virtual, modern retelling of The Sword and the Stone. More than just a weapon, the Master Sword came to be a symbol of Link's destiny, sealing him to the split timeline dividing the fate of Hyrule in the Legend of Zelda series.\"The sword has received mixed comments with regards to its performance in gameplay. Sam Skopp for Looper highlighted the impracticality of the Master Sword in gameplay, noting that this is, \"not the result of its physical design, but rather how it manifests throughout the Zelda franchise\". He continued by explaining that due to the prolonged quest lines in A Link to the Past and in Breath of the Wild, the Master Sword is \"an impractical thing to obtain in the first place\". Stephen Lagioia writing for Screen Rant highlighted the strengths of the Master Sword in the gameplay of Breath of the Wild stating, \"While there are in fact stronger weapons in the game, it's hard to find a weapon that's all-around efficient as Link's iconic Master Sword. The perk of it never breaking gives it immense added value on its own, even when factoring in its 10-minute recharge. Add its attack power of 30 (which doubles when facing Calamity foes) and the Master Sword is a surefire pick.\" Avery Lawrence Feyrer for TheGamer chose the Master Sword as the most powerful weapon in video game history, ranking it above the Blue shell from Mario Kart, and describing it as, \"arguably the most iconic weapon in video game history, and the most powerful.\"Several critics have highlighted the impact and legacy of the weapon within gaming. The Master Sword was ranked as one of \"The Coolest Swords Ever Seen in a Video Game\" by Ron Whitaker for The Escapist magazine, who commented, \"the Master Sword doesn't look all that special. It's not that big, it doesn't have flames rising from it, and it doesn't look all that intimidating. But in the hands of the right person, it can save the world.\" Whitaker also listed it as one of the most iconic video game weapons stating, \"It has the ability to repel evil, and in Ocarina of Time, it can be used to travel through time. In A Link to the Past, Link can even upgrade the sword to make it even more powerful. It\u2019s appeared in several other games, been created by swordsmiths and cosplayers alike, just as you would expect for such an iconic weapon.\" IGN staff consider the Master Sword to be the greatest or most iconic video game weapon of all time, and the act of pulling it out in Ocarina of Time the most unforgettable video game moment of all time. Destin Legarie from IGN wrote, \"This beautiful sword is an icon to gamers everywhere, as well as an instantly recognizable item of central importance in the Zelda franchise. Sure, there have been plenty of great weapons and items in The Legend of Zelda series, but only the Master Sword has endured since the days of A Link to the Past. Each story since the Super Nintendo entry has been crafted around Link's quest to obtain this legendary blade.\"\n\nSee also\nIt's dangerous to go alone!\n\n\n== References ==",
    "Open world": "In video games, an open world is a game mechanic of using a virtual world that the player can explore and approach objectives freely, as opposed to a world with more linear and structured gameplay. While games have used open-world designs since the 1980s, the implementation in Grand Theft Auto III (2001) set a standard for the concept which has been used since.Games with open or free-roaming worlds typically lack level structures like walls and locked doors, or the invisible walls in more open areas that prevent the player from venturing beyond them; only at the bounds of an open-world game will players be limited by geographic features like vast oceans or impassable mountains. Players typically do not encounter loading screens common in linear level designs when moving about the game world, with the open-world game using strategic storage and memory techniques to load the game world in a dynamic and seamless manner. Open-world games still enforce many restrictions in the game environment, either because of absolute technical limitations or in-game limitations imposed by a game's linearity.While the openness of the game world is an important facet to games featuring open worlds, the main draw of open-world games is about providing the player with autonomy \u2013 not so much the freedom to do anything they want in the game (which is nearly impossible with current computing technology), but the ability to choose how to approach the game and its challenges in the order and manner as the player desires while still constrained by gameplay rules. Examples of high level of autonomy in computer games can be found in massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG) or in single-player games adhering to the open-world concept such as the Fallout series. The main appeal of open-world gameplay is that it provides a simulated reality and allows players to develop their character and its behavior in the direction and pace of their own choosing. In these cases, there is often no concrete goal or end to the game, although there may be the main storyline, such as with games like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.\n\nGameplay and design\nAn open world is a level or game designed as nonlinear, open areas with many ways to reach an objective. Some games are designed with both traditional and open-world levels. An open world facilitates greater exploration than a series of smaller levels, or a level with more linear challenges. Reviewers have judged the quality of an open world based on whether there are interesting ways for the player to interact with the broader level when they ignore their main objective. Some games actually use real settings to model an open world, such as New York City.A major design challenge is to balance the freedom of an open world with the structure of a dramatic storyline. Since players may perform actions that the game designer did not expect, the game's writers must find creative ways to impose a storyline on the player without interfering with their freedom. As such, games with open worlds will sometimes break the game's story into a series of missions, or have a much simpler storyline altogether. Other games instead offer side-missions to the player that do not disrupt the main storyline. Most open-world games make the character a blank slate that players can project their own thoughts onto, although several games such as Landstalker: The Treasures of King Nole offer more character development and dialogue. Writing in 2005, David Braben described the narrative structure of current video games as \"little different to the stories of those Harold Lloyd films of the 1920s\", and considered genuinely open-ended stories to be the \"Holy Grail we are looking for in fifth generation gaming\". Gameplay designer Manveer Heir, who worked on Mass Effect 3 and Mass Effect Andromeda for Electronic Arts, said that there are difficulties in the design of an open-world game since it is difficult to predict how players will approach solving gameplay challenges offered by a design, in contrast to a linear progression, and needs to be a factor in the game's development from its onset. Heir opined that some of the critical failings of Andromeda were due to the open world being added late in development.Some open-world games, to guide the player towards major story events, do not provide the world's entire map at the start of the game, but require the player to complete a task to obtain part of that map, often identifying missions and points of interest when they view the map. This has been derogatorily referred to as \"Ubisoft towers\", as this mechanic was promoted in Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed series (the player climbing a large tower as to observe the landscape around it and identify waypoints nearby) and reused in other Ubisoft games, including Far Cry, Might & Magic X: Legacy and Watch Dogs. Other games that use this approach include Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Rockstar games like GTA IV and the Red Dead Redemption series lock out sections of the map as \"barricaded by law enforcement\" until a specific point in the story has been  reached.\nGames with open worlds typically give players infinite lives or continues, although some force the player to start from the beginning should they die too many times. There is also a risk that players may get lost as they explore an open world; thus designers sometimes try to break the open world into manageable sections. The scope of open-world games requires the developer to fully detail every possible section of the world the player may be able to access, unless methods like procedural generation are used. The design process, due to its scale, may leave numerous game world glitches, bugs, incomplete sections, or other irregularities that players may find and potentially take advantage of. The term \"open world jank\" has been used to apply to games where the incorporation of the open world gameplay elements may be poor, incomplete, or unnecessary to the game itself such that these glitches and bugs become more apparent, though are generally not game-breaking, such as the case for No Man's Sky near its launch.\n\nOpen world, sandbox games, and emergent gameplay\nThe mechanics of open-world games are often overlapped with ideas of sandbox games, but these are considered different terms. Whereas open world refers to the lack of limits for the player's exploration of the game's world, sandbox games are based on the ability of giving the player tools for creative freedom within the game to approach objectives, if such objectives are present. For example, Microsoft Flight Simulator is an open-world game as one can fly anywhere within the mapped world, but is not considered a sandbox game as there are few creative aspects brought into the game.The combination of open world and sandbox mechanics can lead towards emergent gameplay, complex reactions that emerge (either expectedly or unexpectedly) from the interaction of relatively simple game mechanics. According to Peter Molyneux, emergent gameplay appears wherever a game has a good simulation system that allows players to play in the world and have it respond realistically to their actions. It is what made SimCity and The Sims compelling to players. Similarly, being able to freely interact with the city's inhabitants in Grand Theft Auto added an extra dimension to the series.In recent years game designers have attempted to encourage emergent play by providing players with tools to expand games through their own actions. Examples include in-game web browsers in EVE Online and The Matrix Online; XML integration tools and programming languages in Second Life; shifting exchange rates in Entropia Universe; and the complex object-and-grammar system used to solve puzzles in Scribblenauts. Other examples of emergence include interactions between physics and artificial intelligence. One challenge that remains to be solved, however, is how to tell a compelling story using only emergent technology.In an op-ed piece for BBC News, David Braben, co-creator of Elite, called truly open-ended game design \"The Holy Grail\" of modern video gaming, citing games like Elite and the Grand Theft Auto series as early steps in that direction. Peter Molyneux has also stated that he believes emergence (or emergent gameplay) is where video game development is headed in the future. He has attempted to implement open-world gameplay to a great extent in some of his games, particularly Black & White and Fable.\n\nProcedural generation of open worlds\nProcedural generation refers to content generated algorithmically rather than manually, and is often used to generate game levels and other content. While procedural generation does not guarantee that a game or sequence of levels is nonlinear, it is an important factor in reducing game development time and opens up avenues making it possible to generate larger and more or less unique seamless game worlds on the fly and using fewer resources. This kind of procedural generation is known as worldbuilding, in which general rules are used to construct a believable world.\nMost 4X and roguelike games make use of procedural generation to some extent to generate game levels. SpeedTree is an example of a developer-oriented tool used in the development of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and aimed at speeding up the level design process. Procedural generation also made it possible for the developers of Elite, David Braben and Ian Bell, to fit the entire game\u2014including thousands of planets, dozens of trade commodities, multiple ship types and a plausible economic system\u2014into less than 22 kilobytes of memory. More recently, No Man's Sky procedurally generated over 18 quintillion planets including flora, fauna, and other features that can be researched and explored.\n\nHistory\n20th century\nThere is no consensus on what the earliest open-world game is, due to differing definitions of how large or open a world needs to be. Inverse provides some early examples games that established elements of the open world: Jet Rocket, a 1970 Sega electro-mechanical arcade game that, while not a video game, predated the flight simulator genre to give the player free roaming capabilities, and dnd, a 1975 text-based adventure game for the PLATO system that offered non-linear gameplay. Ars Technica traces the concept back to the free-roaming exploration of 1976 text adventure game Colossal Cave Adventure, which inspired the free-roaming exploration of Adventure (1980), but notes that it was not until 1984 that what \"we now know as open-world gaming\" took on a \"definite shape\" with 1984 space simulator Elite, considered a pioneer of the open world; Gamasutra argues that its open-ended sandbox style is rooted in flight simulators, such as SubLOGIC's Flight Simulator (1979/1980), noting most flight sims \"offer a 'free flight' mode that allows players to simply pilot the aircraft and explore the virtual world\". Others trace the concept back to 1981 CRPG Ultima, which had a free-roaming overworld map inspired by tabletop RPG Dungeons & Dragons. The overworld maps of the first five Ultima games, released up to 1988, lacked a single, unified scale, with towns and other places represented as icons; this style was adopted by the first three Dragon Quest games, released from 1986 to 1988 in Japan.Early examples of open-world gameplay in adventure games include The Portopia Serial Murder Case (1983) and The Lords of Midnight (1984), with open-world elements also found in The Hobbit (1982) and Valhalla (1983). The strategy video game, The Seven Cities of Gold (1984), is also cited as an early open-world game, influencing Sid Meier's Pirates! (1987). Eurogamer also cites British computer games such as Ant Attack (1983) and Sabre Wulf (1984) as early examples.According to Game Informer's Kyle Hilliard, Hydlide (1984) and The Legend of Zelda (1986) were among the first open-world games, along with Ultima. IGN traces the roots of open-world game design to The Legend of Zelda, which it argues is \"the first really good game based on exploration\", while noting that it was anticipated by Hydlide, which it argues is \"the first RPG that rewarded exploration\". According to GameSpot, never \"had a game so open-ended, nonlinear, and liberating been released for the mainstream market\" with The Legend of Zelda. According to The Escapist, The Legend of Zelda was an early example of open-world, nonlinear gameplay, with an expansive and cohesive world, inspiring many games to adopt a similar open-world design.Mercenary (1985) has been cited as the first open world 3D action-adventure game. There were also other open-world games in the 1980s, such as Back to Skool (1985), Turbo Esprit (1986) and Alternate Reality: The City (1985). Wasteland, released in 1988, is also considered an open-world game. The early 1990s saw open-world games such as The Terminator (1990), The Adventures of Robin Hood (1991), and Hunter (1991), which IGN describes as the first sandbox game to feature full 3D, third-person graphics, and Ars Technica argues \"has one of the strongest claims to the title of GTA forebear\". Sierra On-Line's 1992 adventure game King's Quest VI has an open world; almost half of the quests are optional, many have multiple solutions, and players can solve most in any order. Atari Jaguar launch title, Cybermorph (1993), was notable for its open 3D polygonal-world and non-linear gameplay. Quarantine (1994) is an example of an open-world driving game from this period, while Iron Soldier (1994) is an open-world mech game. The director of 1997's Blade Runner argues that that game was the first open world three-dimensional action adventure game.\n\nIGN considers Nintendo's Super Mario 64 (1996) revolutionary for its 3D open-ended free-roaming worlds, which had rarely been seen in 3D games before, along with its analog stick controls and camera control. Other 3D examples include Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon (1997), Ocarina of Time (1998), the DMA Design (Rockstar North) game Body Harvest (1998), the Angel Studios (Rockstar San Diego) games Midtown Madness (1999) and Midnight Club: Street Racing (2000), the Reflections Interactive (Ubisoft Reflections) game Driver (1999), and the Rareware games Banjo-Kazooie (1998), Donkey Kong 64 (1999), and Banjo-Tooie (2000).1UP considers Sega's adventure Shenmue (1999) the originator of the \"open city\" subgenre, touted as a \"FREE\" (\"Full Reactive Eyes Entertainment\") game giving players the freedom to explore an expansive sandbox city with its own day-night cycles, changing weather, and fully voiced non-player characters going about their daily routines. The game's large interactive environments, wealth of options, level of detail and the scope of its urban sandbox exploration has been compared to later sandbox games like Grand Theft Auto III and its sequels, Sega's own Yakuza series, Fallout 3, and Deadly Premonition.\n\n21st century\nGrand Theft Auto has had over 200 million sales. Creative director Gary Penn, who previously worked on Frontier: Elite II, cited Elite as a key influence, calling it \"basically Elite in a city\", and mentioned other team members being influenced by Syndicate and Mercenary.  Grand Theft Auto III combined elements from previous games, and fused them together into a new immersive 3D experience that helped define open-world games for a new generation. Executive producer Sam Houser described it as \"Zelda meets Goodfellas\", while producer Dan Houser also cited The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Super Mario 64 as influences. Radio stations had been implemented earlier in games such as Maxis' SimCopter (1996), the ability to beat or kill non-player characters date back to titles such as Portopia (1983), and Valhalla (1983) and the way in which players run over pedestrians and get chased by police has been compared to Pac-Man (1980). After the release of Grand Theft Auto III, many games which employed a 3D open world, such as Ubisoft's Watch Dogs and Deep Silver's Saints Row series, were labeled, often disparagingly, as Grand Theft Auto clones, much as how many early first-person shooters were called \"Doom clones\".Other examples include World of Warcraft, The Elder Scrolls and Fallout series of games, which feature a large and diverse world, offering tasks and possibilities to play.\nIn the Assassin's Creed series, which began in 2007, players explore historic open-world settings. These include the Holy Land during the Third Crusade in Assassin's Creed, Renaissance Italy in Assassin's Creed II and Brotherhood, Constantinople during the rise of the Ottoman Empire in Assassin's Creed Revelations, New England during the American Revolution in Assassin's Creed III, the Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy in Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, the North Atlantic during the French and Indian War in Assassin's Creed Rogue, Paris during the French Revolution in Assassin's Creed Unity, London at the onset of the Second Industrial Revolution in Assassin's Creed Syndicate, Ptolemaic Egypt in Assassin's Creed Origins, Classical Greece during the Peloponnesian War in Assassin's Creed Odyssey, and Medieval England and Norway during the Viking Age in Assassin's Creed Valhalla. The series intertwines factual history with a fictional storyline. In the fictional storyline, the Templars and the Assassins, two secret organisations inspired by their real-life counterparts, have been mortal enemies for all of known history. Their conflict stems from the Templars' desire to have peace through control, which directly contrasts the Assassins' wish for peace with free will. Their fighting influences much of history, as the sides often back real historical forces. For example, during the American Revolution depicted in Assassin's Creed III, the Templars initially support the British, while the Assassins side with the American colonists.\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl was developed by GSC Game World in 2007, followed by two other games, a prequel and a sequel. The free world style of the zone was divided into huge maps, like sectors, and the player can go from one sector to another, depending on required quests or just by choice.\nIn 2011, Dan Ryckert of Game Informer wrote that open-world crime games were \"a major force\" in the gaming industry for the preceding decade.Another popular open-world sandbox game is Minecraft, which has since become the best-selling video game of all time, selling over 238 million copies worldwide on multiple platforms by April 2021. Minecraft's procedurally generated overworlds cover a virtual 3.6 billion square kilometers.\nThe Outerra Engine is a world rendering engine in development since 2008 that is capable of seamlessly rendering whole planets from space down to ground level. Anteworld is a world-building game and free tech-demo of the Outerra Engine that builds upon real-world data to render planet Earth realistically on a true-to-life scale.No Man's Sky, released in 2016, is an open-world game set in a virtually infinite universe. According to the developers, through procedural generation, the game is able to produce more than 18 quintillion (18\u00d71018 or 18,000,000,000,000,000,000) planets to explore. Several critics found that the nature of the game can become repetitive and monotonous, with the survival gameplay elements being lackluster and tedious. Jake Swearingen in New York said, \"You can procedurally generate 18.6 quintillion unique planets, but you can't procedurally generate 18.6 quintillion unique things to do.\" Updates have aimed to address these criticisms.\nIn 2017, the open-world design of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was described by critics as being revolutionary and by developers as a paradigm shift for open-world design. In contrast to the more structured approach of most open-world games, Breath of the Wild features a large and fully interactive world that is generally unstructured and rewards the exploration and manipulation of its world. Inspired by the original 1986 Legend of Zelda, the open world of Breath of the Wild integrates multiplicative gameplay, where \"objects react to the player's actions and the objects themselves also influence each other.\" Along with a physics engine, the game's open-world also integrates a chemistry engine, \"which governs the physical properties of certain objects and how they relate to each other,\" rewarding experimentation. Nintendo has described the game's approach to open-world design as \"open-air\".\n\nSee also\nPersistent world\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nMoss, Richard (March 25, 2017). \"Roam free: A history of open-world gaming\".

    "List of The Legend of Zelda media": "The Legend of Zelda is a video game series created by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka, developed and published by Nintendo. The series debuted in Japan with The Legend of Zelda on February 21, 1986, and was later released in North America (August 22, 1987) and Europe (November 27, 1987). The Legend of Zelda video games have been developed exclusively for Nintendo video game consoles and handhelds, dating from the Family Computer Disk System to the current generation of video game consoles. Spin-off titles, however, have been released on non-Nintendo systems. The franchise currently consists of 29 video games, including original titles, ports, remakes, and collections. Over 52 million copies have been sold since the release of the first game. The franchise also includes an American cartoon adaptation, multiple comic book adaptations, and soundtracks.\nGameplay consists of a mixture of action, adventure, puzzle-solving, and role-playing video games. The series centers on Link, the main protagonist and player character. Link is often given the task of rescuing Princess Zelda and the most common setting of the series, Hyrule, from Ganon, the series' primary antagonist. Other minor settings and antagonists have appeared throughout the series; Vaati has become one of the series' recurring antagonists. Games in The Legend of Zelda series with two-dimensional (2D) graphics feature side-scrolling or overhead view gameplay, while games with three-dimensional (3D) graphics give the player a third-person perspective.

    "Characters of The Legend of Zelda": "The Legend of Zelda is a high-fantasy video game series created by Japanese game designers Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka. It is primarily developed and published by Nintendo, although some portable installments have been outsourced to Capcom, Vanpool and Grezzo. The series' gameplay incorporates elements of action, adventure and puzzle-solving games.\nThe series centers on Link, the playable character and chief protagonist. Link is often given the task of rescuing Princess Zelda and the kingdom of Hyrule from Ganon, who is the series' principal antagonist; however, other settings and antagonists have appeared in several games. The plots commonly involve a relic known as the Triforce, a set of three omnipotent golden triangles.\nSince the original The Legend of Zelda's release in 1986, the series has expanded to include 19 entries on all of Nintendo's major game consoles, as well as a number of spin-offs. An American animated TV series based on the games aired in 1989. Individual manga adaptations commissioned by Nintendo have been produced in Japan since 1997. The Legend of Zelda is one of Nintendo's most prominent and successful franchises, selling over 80 million copies as of 2017; many of its games are considered by critics and fans alike to be among the greatest video games of all time.\n\nOverview\nList indicator(s)\nA dark grey cell indicates that the character was not in the property or that the character's presence in the property has yet to be announced.\nA Main indicates a character had a starring role in the property.\nA Recurring indicates the character appeared in two or more times within the property.\nA Guest indicates the character appeared once in the property.\n\nProtagonists\nLink\nLink is a Hylian youth who characteristically wears a green tunic and pointed cap. He has pointed ears and the Triforce symbol on his left hand. Each incarnation of Link is humble, hard-working, brave, and therefore worthy to bear the Triforce of Courage. The various Links each have a special title, such as \"Hero of Time\" in Ocarina of Time, \"Hero of the Winds\" in The Wind Waker, or \"Hero Chosen by the Gods\" in Twilight Princess. Link is typically left-handed, with a few exceptions. In the Wii version of Twilight Princess, Link is right-handed due to the \"mirroring\" used to accommodate the right-handed control scheme, which flips the entire game world's layout from that of its Nintendo GameCube counterpart. Link is also right-handed in the titles Skyward Sword and Breath of the Wild.  In Ocarina of Time Master Quest, the game is also mirrored and Link is right-handed.\nLink does not normally speak; he usually makes grunting or yelling noises instead of using words and has a companion who speaks for him. One exception is The Wind Waker where he says \"Come on!\" to make other characters or objects follow him. Link does speak in the cartoon series and the CD-i games produced by Philips, but these are not considered canonical by fans with respect to the principal series.In all Zelda games except Breath of the Wild, the player can name Link, and NPCs will refer to him by that name.\n\nPrincess Zelda\nPrincess Zelda is Hyrule's princess and the guardian of the Triforce of Wisdom. While older titles require Link to save Zelda from Ganon, she, since The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time has been mostly shown to be capable in battle, using magical powers and weapons, such as Light Arrows, to aid Link. With the exception of the CD-i games, she was not playable in the series until Spirit Tracks, where she becomes a spirit and can possess a Phantom Knight that can be controlled by the player. Zelda occasionally has aliases and alter egos, including Sheik in Ocarina of Time and Tetra in The Wind Waker and Phantom Hourglass. She is playable in The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks, Hyrule Warriors, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, in the non-canon Smash Bros., as well as the spinoff Cadence of Hyrule.\n\nAntagonists\nGanon\nGanon (known as Ganondorf Dragmire in his Gerudo form) is the series' main villain and most recurring final boss.\nIn the games, Ganondorf is the leader of the desert-dwelling Gerudo race and Link's evil archenemy. His specific motives vary from game to game, but most often include kidnapping Princess Zelda and seeking the Triforce.\nIn many games, he already possesses or acquires a portion of the Triforce called the Triforce of Power, leading him to seek the Triforce of Wisdom and the Triforce of Courage, held by Zelda and Link respectively. In Ocarina of Time, he uses the child Link, who has possession of the Master Sword, to grab the Triforce. Since Ganondorf's heart is only in balance to the Triforce of Power, it breaks in three - Power given to Ganondorf, Courage given to Link (who was in a seven-year unconscious state at the time), and Wisdom to Zelda (who has gone into hiding as Sheik). In order to possess all three, Ganon must vanquish the other two.\nUnlike most other characters, Ganon is the same version of his character in every game with the exception of Four Swords Adventures where he is Ganon's reincarnation. He is also the physical personification of the Demon King Demise's hatred and is destined to reincarnate eternally if he is killed.\n\nAgahnim\nAgahnim is an evil wizard who is a major villain in The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. Appearing during a period of flood, famine, and disease, Agahnim assisted the Royal Family by dispelling multiple plagues and became their trusted advisor for a time. However, he soon displayed his true colors and seized power for himself by killing the King of Hyrule and brainwashing the castle soldiers. Agahnim begins capturing the descendants of the Seven Sages and banishes them to the Dark World to release Ganon from his imprisonment. Link is unable to stop Agahnim from capturing Princess Zelda, but he is able to defeat Agahnim by using the Master Sword to reflect the wizard's magic onto himself.\nAs a last act of defiance, Agahnim escapes to the Dark World and drags Link with him, beginning the second half of the game's plot. Near the end of the game, Agahnim meets Link again on top of Ganon's Tower and is finally slain after another battle, where it is revealed that his body is a vessel for Ganon's soul.\nIn Link's Awakening, Agahnim's Shadow was one of the Shadows of Link's former foes who attacked Link in the final battle in Koholint Island's Wind Fish Egg.\n\nNightmares\nNightmares are evil monsters who invaded the island of Koholint and are the primary villains of The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening and its remake. They want to rule Koholint, and do this by preventing Link from waking up the Wind Fish by hiding the eight Instruments of the Sirens in eight different dungeons filled with traps and monsters, and guarded by them.\nThey are:\n\nMoldorm, a segmented worm who guards the Full Moon Cello in the Tail Cave.\nGenie, a clown-like spirit in a jar who guards the Conch Horn in the Bottle Grotto.\nSlime Eye, a huge, one-eyed slime who guards the Sea Lily's Bell in the Key Cavern.\nAngler Fish, a huge angler fish who guards the Surf Harp in the Angler's Tunnel.\nSlime Eel, a massive eel who guards the Wind Marimba in the Catfish's Maw.\nFa\u00e7ade, a disembodied face who guards the Coral Triangle in the Face Shrine.\nEvil Eagle, a huge, bizarre-looking eagle who guards the Organ of Evening Calm in the Eagle's Tower.\nHot Head, a disembodied head cloaked in fire who guards the Thunder Drum in the Turtle Rock.\nDethI, a shadowy being who is the one who put the Wind Fish to sleep and the final Nightmare to face.\n\nDark Link\nDark Link (also known as Shadow Link in Oracle of Ages and Four Swords Adventures) is a recurring boss and a doppelg\u00e4nger of Link. Dark Link is usually solid black with red eyes but is white with purple hair in the Four Swords Plus manga. In general, Dark Link copies Link's swordplay, but can use Link's full arsenal of weapons in some games. When he first appears in The Adventure of Link, he is the final boss, created by a mysterious wizard as a test for earning the Triforce of Courage. In Oracle of Ages, Shadow Links are summoned by the sorceress Veran, who summons Shadow Links during the final battle that impede Link's ability to target her.\nShadow Link's appearances include that of the main character, a recurring boss, and respawning enemies in Four Swords Adventures. These Shadow Links are created by the Dark Mirror, and one tricks Link into drawing the Four Sword from the Four Sword Shrine, which releases Vaati and splits Link into four. They plague the Links throughout the game by both directly attacking him, and impersonating him while they attack Hyrule's citizens, causing them to be suspicious and distrusting of the Links. The Links eventually eradicate Vaati in a final battle  while Zelda undoes the seal on the Dark Mirror and takes it into her possession. However, in the manga, Shadow Link destroys the mirror, and ultimately himself, to save the Links from Vaati.\nDark Link also appears in both Ocarina of Time and its manga, but only serves as a character in the manga. While Link is in Kakariko Village, a shadowy substance emerges from the well, grabs a child, and then manifests as Dark Link. It attacks Link and initially has the upper hand due to Link's overall lack of skill, but Link eventually manages to hit it. At this point, it re-manifests riding a horse, which Link and Epona battle and soon defeat. In Ocarina of Time, he is a sub-boss in the Water Temple, which copies almost all of Link's attacks.\nThough not actually appearing in the game, Breath of the Wild features an armor set resembling Dark Link that Link can purchase after freeing all four Divine Beasts. When wearing the full set, Link can run faster at night and also scare non-player characters who see him.\nDark Link appears in Super Smash Bros. Melee and Super Smash Bros. Brawl as an enemy in one of the Event Matches, as well as an alternate costume for Link and Toon Link in Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, and subsequently Young Link in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. In Hyrule Warriors, Dark Link appears as an in-game opponent and as a downloadable costume for Link.\nIn 2010 IGN ranked Dark Link as 77th on its list of the Top 100 Video Game Villains.\n\nTwinrova\nKotake and Koume, collectively referred to as the Twinrova Sisters (), are a pair of Gerudo witches who are the surrogate mothers and servants of the Gerudo King Ganondorf. They can brainwash others to serve Ganondorf and merge to form the stronger witch Twinrova; the brooms they use to fly become scepters that channel Twinrova's power.\nThey appear in Majora's Mask, but are more benevolent than their Ocarina of Time counterparts. They reside in the Southern Swamp, with Kotake running a potion shop and Koume operating a tour-boat service. At one point, the Skull Kid injures Koume, who asks Link to bring her a red potion from Kotake's store to heal. After healing Koume from the woods and returning the swamp to normal, she hosts a shooting game which yields a Piece of Heart.\nKotake and Koume are villains in Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages. They send their servants Onox and Veran to Holodrum and Labrynna to obtain the energy needed to resurrect Ganon. Near the end of the second game, they capture Princess Zelda and prepare to offer her up as a sacrifice to finish the spell. Link follows the witches to their chambers with help from the Oracles Din and Nayru, and Koume and Kotake fight him as both separate witches and in their fused Twinrova form. After its defeat, Twinrova sacrifices herself in place of Zelda to complete the spell, but this results in Ganon being resurrected as a mindless beast, which Link defeats.\n\nMajora\n\"Majora\" is the titular main villain of Majora's Mask; once used by a nameless tribe for hexing and torture. The mask is primarily seen being worn over the face of Skull Kid, who, corrupted by Majora's influences, uses the mask's dark magic to wreak havoc across Termina. During the final boss, two more forms of Majora are shown; Majora's Incarnation and Majora's Wrath. Both are humanoid creatures, though Majora's Wrath has long, whip-like arms. Skull Kid, with Majora's Mask, also appears as an assist trophy in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.\n\nVaati\nVaati (Japanese: \u30b0\u30d5\u30fc, Hepburn: Guf\u016b) is the antagonist of The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords and The Minish Cap and the secondary antagonist of Four Swords Adventures. His most common appearance is a black orb with a single eye, though he was originally a human-shaped sorcerer. In Four Swords, Vaati is initially sealed in the Four Sword weapon but escapes and captures Princess Zelda, only to be returned to the sword by Link, who is split into four by the sword. In the sequel, Four Swords Adventures, he escapes with Princess Zelda yet again with the help of Ganon, forcing Link to be split up and defeat him.\nBefore the events of The Minish Cap, Vaati was a Picori that became corrupted by the evil in the hearts of mankind. He used the Wishing Cap created by his master, Ezlo, to transform himself into a Hylian sorcerer, and in the game, he begins seeking out the power of the Light Force. He eventually assumes his black orb form in this game.\n\nZant\nUsurper King Zant is the enemy of the Twili who willingly offered himself to Ganondorf, whom he saw as a god, so he could dispose of Midna and invade Hyrule. Though Midna recruits Link to help her collect Fused Shadows so she can regain both her original form and her birthright as the ruler of the Twili, Zant reveals his curse on Midna was placed by Ganon after being fatally wounded. The final battle against Zant involves fighting him in the arenas of other bosses and sub-bosses before fighting him in front of Hyrule Castle. During the events of Hyrule Warriors, Cia summons Zant from the past to fight for her before he becomes a follower of the revived Ganondorf following Cia's defeat.\n\nDemise\nDemon King Demise, a deity who had conquered time itself, was punished by the Goddess Hylia and turned into a monster called the Imprisoned when he tried to take the Triforce. His sword, which assumes the form of the arrogant Demon Lord Ghirahim, tracks down Hylia's reincarnation (Zelda, who is not yet a princess in this title of the franchise) and uses her lifeforce to resurrect Demise. Impressed to see a Hylian like Link willing to stand up to him, Demise decides to battle him out of amusement. After Link mortally wounds him and restores Zelda's soul to her body, Demise's remains are sealed within the Master Sword. Demise's final words speak of a new incarnation of his malice living on, alluding to Ganondorf and the bonds that tie him with Zelda and Link's descendants which is confirmed in Hyrule Historia and Hyrule Warriors as Ganondorf is Demise's reincarnation. In Hyrule Warriors, Demise appears in his Imprisoned form before being defeated, with Ghirahim eventually serving Ganondorf while sensing his master's presence in him referencing that Ganondorf is Demise reincarnated.\n\nGhirahim\nDemon Lord Ghirahim is encountered several times throughout Skyward Sword, as he relentlessly pursues Zelda to revive Demise. Though he appears delicate and acts in a playful, flamboyant, conceited manner, Ghirahim is a cruel sadist with a dangerous short-fused temper. He arrogantly toys with Link in their first two battles, then reveals his full power in a final battle prior to Demise's release. With his mission accomplished, Ghirahim is revealed to be the spirit of Demise's sword, given life so he could resurrect his master. He returns to his sword form before being shattered during Demise's climactic battle with Link. During the events of Hyrule Warriors, Cia summons Ghirahim from the past to fight for her before he becomes a follower of Ganondorf after her defeat. Ghirahim also appears in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U as an Assist Trophy.\n\nYuga\nYuga is the main villain of The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds. He hunted the descendants of the Seven Sages and Princess Zelda to resurrect Ganon and use his power to rule the worlds of Hyrule and Lorule. He is a sorcerer who can transform himself and others into two-dimensional art. With his magic staff, he can trap people within picture frames, turning them into Lorule paintings.\n\nCia\nCia is the main villain of the first half of Hyrule Warriors. Appointed as the guardian of the Triforce of Power with control over time, she was once a kindhearted young woman who had feelings for Link until her jealousy for Zelda allowed Ganondorf to corrupt her soul with evil, barring a single remaining portion of good that manifests as her twin, Lana. After gathering a mighty army, Cia uses her powers to open gates through time to cause havoc and destruction so that Ganondorf can return, after which he abandons her. This only causes Cia to grow even more obsessed and dangerous, and she is ultimately killed in battle.\nIn the expansion Hyrule Warriors Legends, Cia is discovered to still be alive in the world of The Wind Waker, as the evil Phantom Ganon is using her power to cross his world into Hyrule and conquer both. With help from Tetra and King Daphnes, Link and Lana revive Cia and the five of them banish Phantom Ganon, restoring the worlds to normal. Cia and Lana then leave to watch over the Triforce together in peace.\n\nVolga\nVolga is a major antagonist in Hyrule Warriors. His name and design is based on the dragon Volvagia from Ocarina of Time, even transforming into the dragon itself in some of his attacks. Cia finds him in the Eldin Caves and uses her power to brainwash him into her service, becoming one of her strongest generals and a recurring opponent for the heroes and especially Link to overcome. Volga eventually breaks free of Cia's control and demands a final battle with the heroes so that he can die satisfied as himself.\n\nWizzro\nWizzro appears in Hyrule Warriors and is a unique character based on the recurring Wizzrobe enemy seen through the series. He inhabits a cursed ring that the Gorons have sealed in the Eldin Caves and is awakened by Cia to become one of her main subordinates. Wizzro agrees and appears throughout the story under Cia's command, often using his magic to confuse the heroes by disguising himself as their allies. He later abandons her to side with Ganondorf, forcing Cia to eliminate her treacherous ally.\n\nThe Yiga Clan\nThe Yiga Clan is a group of traitorous Sheikah who ten millennia prior turned against the Royal Family of Hyrule and now support Calamity Ganon by killing all who oppose him, especially Link. Their soldiers often disguise themselves as wandering travelers and attack Link when he stops to talk with them, and they are exceptionally-skilled in espionage and theft, having stolen heirlooms from the Sheikah and Gerudo. For some reason, they are completely obsessed with bananas; Yiga soldiers will drop them when defeated, and the guards in their hideout will abandon their posts briefly to grab any they see.\n\nMaster Kohga\nMaster Kohga is a character in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and the leader of the Yiga Clan, though the name itself is actually stated to be a title passed down between leaders. Lazy and egotistical, Kohga spends most of his time sleeping in the Yiga Clan's hideout, located in the desert through the Karusa Valley, while the rest of his clan scour Hyrule in search of Link. In order to retrieve the Gerudo's Thunder Helm, Link infiltrates the Yiga hideout and confronts Kohga, who unintentionally kills himself by summoning a spiked ball that rolls over him and sends him falling to his demise. With his last words, Kohga swears that the Yiga will pursue Link forever, which proves to not be an idle threat as their random attacks will become more frequent for the rest of the game.\nIn Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, Kohga is aided by Sooga, a powerful Yiga warrior recognized for his twin swords, fountain-style hair and cracked mask; Sooga acts as the second-in-command of the Yiga. Kohga considers him his \"best lackey\". When Astor betrays them by using the souls of Yiga Footsoldiers as sacrifices for Calamity Ganon, Sooga and Kohga swear to avenge their comrades and attack the evil seer. Kohga survives the encounter, but Sooga's fate is unknown. In order for the Yiga to get revenge on Astor for their fallen comrades, Kohga swears fealty to the Hyruleans forces. It is implied, however, that Kohga still recognises Calamity Ganon as his master, though the weakened Yiga do not dare to go against Zelda and her awakened sealing power.\n\nAstor\nAstor is the main villain of Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity. Though little is known about him, he seeks the revival of Calamity Ganon above all else. He is able to harness the evil power of Calamity Ganon, dubbed Malice, in his attacks and can use it to summon the Blight Ganons and evil clones of the Champions called Hollows. Astor is accompanied by a small Malice-possessed Guardian called Harbinger Ganon, who he claims speaks of the future and uses this knowledge to guide the Yiga Clan and the various monsters of Hyrule in working together towards Calamity Ganon's revival. After being defeated in Hyrule Castle, Harbinger Ganon destroys Astor and uses his power to fully manifest as Calamity Ganon.\n\nSupporting characters\nEpona\nEpona is Link's horse who assists him in Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, Twilight Princess and Breath of the Wild. She comes to Link's aid when called by her special song, which he plays on the ocarina in Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, and on a blade of Horse Grass in Twilight Princess.\n\nFi\nFi () is a female humanoid representation of the Goddess Sword, which later evolves into the Master Sword, in Skyward Sword. Fi serves as Link's companion and assists him throughout the game, though she has a logical mindset and grows to understand her master and others. In the end, after Demise is sealed within the Master Sword, Fi reveals her last order from the goddess is to let Link put her into an endless sleep within the weapon, which he does after encouragement from Fi and Zelda. Fi appears as a playable character in Hyrule Warriors.\n\nGolden Goddesses\nThe three Golden Goddesses (Din, Farore and Nayru) are responsible for the creation of Hyrule, as well as the creation of the Triforce, which houses a fraction of their divine power. Din is the Goddess of Power, associated with the color red and the elements of earth and fire; Farore is the Goddess of Courage, associated with the color green and the elements of wind and forest; and Nayru is the Goddess of Wisdom, associated with the color blue and the elements of water and time. Each Goddess is also associated with a fragment of the Triforce\u2013 Din with the Triforce of Power, Farore with the Triforce of Courage, and Nayru with the Triforce of Wisdom. Each Goddess has a spell that Link may acquire from a Great Fairy\u2013 Din's Fire, Farore's Wind, and Nayru's Love. These three spells are used by Princess Zelda in Super Smash Bros. Melee and Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Statues appear in The Wind Waker, depicting the three Goddesses. These statues are arranged in a triangular shape.\nThree humanoid women of the same name exist in Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages. Din is the Oracle of Seasons and Nayru is the Oracle of Ages. Din has red hair and is a dancer. Earlier in the game, she is captured by a knight named Onox, who uses her to disrupt the seasons. Nayru has blue hair and is a singer. She is possessed by the witch Veran, who uses her to disrupt time. Farore has green hair, and lives inside the Maku Tree, an entity in both Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages. She has no relevance to the plot. The Minish Cap uses the same design for the three Oracles. In The Minish Cap, they are travelers who are staying at an inn in town while seeking permanent residence.  Later in the game, Link may only pick two who get to live in their own homes, and, depending on who the player selects, gives him special potions.\nThey do not appear in Twilight Princess though allusions to their names are found in the names of three of the Light Spirits and their respective provinces: Faron (Farore), Eldin (Din), and Lanayru (Nayru). The three can be seen as statues surrounding a carving of the Triforce on top of the Hylian throne in Hyrule Castle.\nIn Skyward Sword, they are collectively referred to as the \"old gods\", in contrast to the goddess Hylia. The first three area zones are named after the Twilight Princess' alterations of their names (Faron Woods, Eldin Volcano, and Lanayru Desert). In Breath of the Wild they had taken the forms of three great dragons. The names of the dragons were Dinraal,\nFarosh, and Naydra.\n\nGreat Deku Tree\nVoiced by: Sean Chiplock (Breath of the Wild and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity)The Great Deku Tree is considered the \"Father of the Forest\".  He first appears in Ocarina of Time, where he is charged with watching over the Kokiri, a childlike race of forest spirits that live in the Kokiri Forest. He is an ancient, exceptionally large tree, with a humanoid face and big mustache.\nWhen Ocarina of Time begins, the Great Deku Tree is suffering from a curse cast upon him by Ganondorf in an effort to gain the Spiritual Stone of the Forest. Knowing Link's destiny, the Deku Tree sends Navi the fairy to retrieve the boy, who is living among the Kokiri as one of them. He asks Link to destroy the cause of the curse, the game's first boss, called Queen Gohma, within him. Although Link defeats Queen Gohma, the Deku Tree was doomed before Link had begun; before he dies, the Deku Tree gives Link the Kokiri's Emerald and tells him to seek Princess Zelda at Hyrule Castle. After adult Link completes the Forest Temple and returns to the site of the Deku Tree, he discovers a little sprout, which grows into the Deku Sprout. The sprout tells Link the truth about his past and reveals that Link is a Hylian entrusted to the Deku Tree by his mother, who died soon after.\nIn The Wind Waker, the Great Deku Tree is the guardian of Forest Haven and is a legendary forest and earth spirit. He is at first plagued by ChuChus and, after Link assists in removing the ChuChus, the Deku Tree tells Link about Forest Haven and the Koroks who live there. He confesses to Link that his energy is waning and that he has become feeble with age. It is assumed that this is the same Deku Tree that was a sprout in Ocarina of Time, as he speaks Hylian and remembers old times when he sees Link's green tunic. He gives Link the Deku Leaf to help him on his quest, and later Farore's Pearl after Link rescues Makar from the Forbidden Woods. Like Valoo and Jabun, he speaks Hylian, but can also speak the modern language of the Great Sea.\nThe Great Deku Tree and its Sprout also appear in Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland. He also appears in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.\n\nGroose\nGroose is a bully from the Knights' Academy in Skyward Sword, initially jealous of Link's relationship with Zelda. He often acts in a hostile manner towards Link and is shown to be a constant source of exasperation for Zelda. Nonetheless he is aided by his gang of goons and their ultimate goal is to undermine Link. Groose is responsible for Link losing his loftwing at the very start of the game. However, following Link to Hyrule, Groose finds himself over his head upon learning he is not the hero, and is forced to accept his subordinate status. Becoming more caring, Groose begins acting more noble. He builds a catapult called \"The Groosenator\" to aid Link in halting The Imprisoned from escaping the pit of the Sealed Grounds and reaching the Sealed Temple, and looks after the elderly overseer of the Sealed Grounds, whom he calls \"Grannie\". He is playable during the last two battles with the imprisoned. In these circumstances, the player can move the Groosenator around the edge of the Sealed Grounds and fire giant bombs at it.\n\nHappy Mask Salesman\nThe Happy Mask Salesman is a mysterious man who travels the world collecting masks. He first appears in Ocarina of Time where he runs the Happy Mask Shop located in Hyrule Castle town during Link's childhood. Here, Link can borrow masks to sell to people around Hyrule. The masks all provoke different responses from the NPCs in the game. If Link returns without enough Rupees to repay the Happy Mask Salesman, he will become enraged and kick Link out of the shop. Once Link sells all the masks, he may borrow any of them, as well as a few extras, which are used purely for humorous purposes. The exception is the Mask of Truth, which Link can use to talk to Gossip Stones.\nIn Majora's Mask, he plays a more integral role. On his travels to find rare masks, he is ambushed by the Skull Kid and his two fairies, Tatl and Tael; they steal Majora's Mask, a powerful, but malevolent, mask. Later, he meets Link inside the Clock Tower in Termina. Noticing that Link has been cursed into a Deku Scrub by the Skull Kid, the Happy Mask Salesman offers to undo the curse in return for Majora's Mask and Link's Ocarina of Time. When Link returns with his ocarina but not Majora's Mask the Happy Mask Salesman becomes enraged at him but quickly calms down and teaches Link the Song of Healing, which breaks the curse transforming him back into his normal form. Once Link finally destroys Majora, the entity inhabiting the mask, the Happy Mask Salesman regains the now-powerless mask, and leaves Link with some advice before walking away, then simply vanishing. It is unknown if he is the same character that appears in Ocarina of Time, as most inhabitants of Termina are counterparts corresponding to inhabitants of Hyrule.\nIn Oracle of Ages, he is found in his shop in Nuun Highlands, in present-day Labrynna. Here, he is suffering from hunger. To help him, Link can give him the Tasty Meat. In return, he gives Link the Doggie Mask, which is part of the trading quest for the Noble Sword.\nIGN ranked him number four on its list of the Top 20 Weirdest Zelda Characters.\n\nImpa\nVoiced by: Andi Gibson (Breath of the Wild and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity)Impa is a caretaker to Princess Zelda. There are many incarnations of the character named Impa throughout the Zelda series, all being from the head family of the Sheikah Tribe, just as there are multiple incarnations of Link and Zelda. As with Link and Zelda, all incarnations of Impa share certain personality traits.\nThe original Impa (appearing in The Legend of Zelda and The Adventure of Link instruction manuals, but not in the actual games) is portrayed as an old woman who calls for Link to save Zelda from Ganon and his henchmen.  The Impa from The Legend of Zelda also inspired a separate incarnation of her who appears in the Philips spin-off Zelda: Wand of Gamelon. In the game, she assists Zelda on her quest by giving her tips provided by the Triforce of Wisdom. Eve Karpf voices Impa in Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon.\nThe Impa of Ocarina of Time is a Sheikah who is both Zelda's bodyguard and a descendant of the tribe that founded Kakariko Village. After Link talks with Princess Zelda, Impa appears and teaches him \"Zelda's Lullaby\" and helps him get out of Hyrule Castle. When Ganondorf attacks Hyrule Castle Town, Impa helps Princess Zelda escape on a white horse. It is later revealed that she is in fact the Sage of Shadow, one of the Six Sages who were led by Princess Zelda herself.\nAn overweight version of Impa is a main character in Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages. In the latter she is briefly possessed by Veran.\nIn Twilight Princess, a character named Impaz dwells in a village with a sign in Hylian text which reads \"Old Kakarico\" [sic], and claims that she is serving both the Royal Family and that she was named after the founder of the village. She is also of the Impa family.\nIn Skyward Sword, Impa is a Sheikah under Hylia assigned to protect Zelda during her time on the surface. Impa appears as both a young time traveler who eventually returns to her time and as the elderly overseer of the Sealed Grounds who eventually passes away once her purpose is fulfilled. This incarnation of Impa is seemingly harsher towards others as shown during the first portion of the story. Even though she knows Link is Hylia's chosen warrior, Impa initially believes him to be incompetent and chastises his inability to protect Zelda. She does become less harsh in her old age.\nIn The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, Lady Impa is once again Zelda's nursemaid, and her lineage from one of the Six Sages is well-known. She is eventually captured by Yuga and is used alongside the other Sages and Princess Zelda to release Ganon. Once Link frees her from the Turtle Rock dungeon, she is sent to the Spirit World to assist him when all Sages are brought together and presents him with the Triforce of Courage.\nImpa appears as a playable character in Hyrule Warriors, with her design and role being a hybrid of her Ocarina of Time and Skyward Sword incarnations. This version of Impa functions as a general in the Hyrulean army, capable of wielding a giant sword or a naginata. Unlike the Ocarina of Time version, Impa is initially oblivious of Sheik's identity which causes her to be distrustful of the ninja. It is only after the defeat of the false Zelda in the Water Temple in the Era of the Hero of Time, that Impa learns Sheik's identity.\nIn Breath of the Wild, she is the elder of Kakariko Village, the Sheikah People's village, and was the former advisor to Hyrule's royal family. She guides Link on his journey and relates some events of the Great Calamity. She is the first incarnation of Impa shown to have family relatives. She is 120 years old, and has a 124 year old sister, Purah, who appears six years old due to a mishap involving a rune when she attempted to make herself younger, and a granddaughter, Paya, who harbors a secret crush on Link. A younger version of Impa appears as a playable character in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity. As a young adult, she looks nearly identical to Paya, though unlike her granddaughter, she has a blue Sheikah symbol on her forehead instead of red.\n\nKaepora Gaebora\nKaepora Gaebora is a wise owl who guides Link throughout various games in the series. One of the Gossip Stones in Ocarina of Time (found in the Sacred Forest Meadow) says he is the reincarnation of an ancient sage. Hyrule Historia claims that his sage is Rauru, the Sage of Light. Despite guiding Link throughout his childhood in Ocarina of Time, he is not encountered while an adult except near the end. He is seen flying over Lon Lon Ranch when Link learns Epona's Song and in shadows when Link learns the Requiem of Spirit but makes no other appearance until Link completes the child half of the Spirit Temple; after that, he is seen flying away during the credits. He is notorious for asking Link if he would like to hear what he said again at the end of each conversation; the default choice is always \"Yes\".\nHe also has a Terminan counterpart (though they may be one and the same) in Majora's Mask, who first appears in the Southern Swamp to teach Link the Song of Soaring, and in Goron Village to help Link cross a large abyss to get the Lens of Truth. There are statues of his likeness spread across Termina which are used as warp points that can be teleported to with the Song of Soaring after Link discovers them. They can be used to save the game temporarily and quit.\nIn Link's Awakening, a similar owl guides Link, and arrives at certain points to provide hints and backstory. He believes in a prophecy that says Link will wake the Wind Fish. In the game's ending, it is revealed that the Owl is a part of the Wind Fish's spirit. Once the Wind Fish awakes, the Owl vanishes along with Koholint Island.\nKaepora Gaebora does not appear in Skyward Sword, but Zelda's father in the game, Gaepora; bears a strong resemblance to him.\n\nKing of Hyrule\nVoiced by: Bill Rogers (Breath of the Wild and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity)The King of Hyrule is the title given to the various ruling monarchs of Hyrule in the Legend of Zelda series. He is the head of the Hyrule Royal Family and the father of Princess Zelda in most of his incarnations.\nThe first mention of a King of Hyrule is in the backstory for The Adventure of Link, where it is explained that he once possessed all three pieces of the Triforce. The Great King, whose tomb is a landmark in the game, concealed the Triforce of Courage in the Great Palace and established the challenges that the future hero would need to complete to reclaim the lost Triforce. In A Link to the Past, the king only appears during the intro and ending credits, as prior to the game he was murdered by Agahnim and restored at the end thanks to Link's wish. In Ocarina of Time, it is stated that Princess Zelda's father is the king and Ganondorf is seen approaching and kneeling before him when Link and Princess Zelda first meet, The king himself is never shown and his fate is never revealed.\nKing Harkinan is the ruler of Hyrule and father to Zelda in the animated series, the Nintendo Comics System, and the CD-i games. In Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon, Zelda must rescue him from Ganon after he is betrayed by his cousin, Duke Onkled.\nKing Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule, better known as the King of Red Lions, is the last king of Hyrule in The Wind Waker. He remained in Hyrule when the gods flooded the kingdom long before the game, and his spirit animates Link's sailboat, the King of Red Lions. As the King of Red Lions, he is a red sailboat with an expressive dragon-like figurehead, and carries Link across the Great Sea. He rescues Link when he is cast out to sea by Ganon, and then guides him to various islands to acquire the power needed to defeat the enemy. Ultimately he reveals his true identity to Link and Tetra before taking Link to find the Triforce of Courage. At the end of the game, he thwarts Ganon by surreptitiously using the united Triforce's wish to ask that old Hyrule is finally washed away and that Link and Tetra have hope for their own future. After Link and Tetra defeat Ganon, the King remains as Hyrule is inundated. King Daphnes appears as a playable character in Hyrule Warriors Legends, with the ability to transform into the King of Red Lions in battle.\nIn The Minish Cap, the current ruler, King Daltus, is a major character during the game, and his ancestor King Gustaf appears to help Link enter the fifth dungeon.\nIn Breath of the Wild, the deceased spirit of King Rhoam Bosphoramus Hyrule poses as an elderly wanderer to aid Link in his quest to save his daughter. He was killed one-hundred years before the game's events by Calamity Ganon. Flashbacks reveal that the King was harsh towards Zelda in completing her training to combat Calamity Ganon and scolded her for spending time researching the Guardians. He planned to apologize to her for his behavior but was killed before he got the chance. King Rhoam also appears as a playable character in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity. In this alternate timeline, he survives after being protected from the berserk Guardians through the use of a Guardian Shield he confiscated from Zelda and Terrako earlier, allowing him to reconcile with his daughter on the Great Plateau.\n\nLinebeck\nLinebeck first appears in Phantom Hourglass as one of the main characters who helps Link save the World of the Ocean King from Bellum. He provides transport for Link in his ship, the S. S. Linebeck, and is greedy and self-centered. For the first half of the game, his goal is to obtain the Ghost Ship's treasure. After the Ghost Ship's treasure is revealed to be merely a rumor devised by Bellum to attract people it, Oshus, revealed as the Ocean King, promises Linebeck one wish if he continues to sail Link across the oceans. This is to be granted after Bellum is defeated. In the endgame, showing a rare burst of courage, Linebeck saves Link and Tetra from Bellum by stabbing him. Bellum, enraged, then possesses Linebeck. After Bellum is defeated by Link once again, he finally dies, and Linebeck is freed. Linebeck has been considerably humbled at this point, however, when the now-restored Ocean King asks him what his wish will be, Linebeck first questions whether he even has to make a wish, then decides that he merely wants to have his ship back (it was destroyed by Bellum just before he possessed Linebeck), rather than asking for some great treasure. After Link and Tetra are returned to their world, Link looks off into the distance, where Linebeck's ship can be seen sailing away.\nIn Spirit Tracks, Linebeck's grandson, Linebeck III, runs Linebeck Trading at the Trading Outpost in New Hyrule. Linebeck III hires a bridgemaker to build a bridge for Link, in exchange for a precious ring he retrieves from the resting place of the original Linebeck.\n\nLana\nLana is a supporting character in Hyrule Warriors. The light counterpart of the dark sorceress Cia, Lana manifested when Ganondorf twisted Cia's feelings for Link into an obsession for conquest. Fleeing into the Faron Woods, Lana created a resistance to fight Cia's growing power. After meeting with Link, Lana pledges to aid and protect him in any way, in part due to her own feelings for him.\nLana fights with a book of magic that controls lightning and has other weapons such as a Deku Spear infused with water magic and a special Summoning Gate that summons various monsters to fight. Even in battle, she maintains a happy and cheery personality and is very energetic.\n\nLinkle\nLinkle is a playable character in Hyrule Warriors and its updated version Hyrule Warriors Legends. A young farmgirl who raises Cuccos in a local village, Linkle believes she is the reincarnated hero, encouraged by her grandmother's stories and the compass she inherited from her. When Cia's forces invade Hyrule, Linkle takes it as a sign that her destiny has come and sets out for Hyrule Castle. Due to her poor sense of direction, Linkle repeatedly loses her way and is drawn into multiple battles where she fights alongside various characters. In battle, Linkle's default weapon is a pair of miniature crossbows; she can also obtain a pair of magical boots to grant her a variety of powerful kicking and dashing attacks.\n\nMidna\nMidna is one of the main characters in The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. She is an imp-like creature and the princess of the Twili race who serves as Link's companion, much like Navi in Ocarina of Time. Initially Midna shows contempt for Link and uses him to further her own goals; however, she grows to like him and continues to help him on his quest. Midna is shown to be a kind-hearted character, even though she was born in the Twilight Realm. She is the counterpart to Link's battles as a wolf in the Realm of Twilight. Midna returns in Hyrule Warriors as a playable character in both her imp and Twili forms.\n\nNavi\nNavi is a fairy who is Link's \"navigator\" throughout The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. The Great Deku Tree in Kokiri Forest instructed Navi to assist Link in his quest to stop Ganondorf. All Kokiri have companion fairies, but because Link is actually a Hylian, he does not receive one until Navi joins him near the beginning of Ocarina of Time. In gameplay, Navi functions primarily as a guide that points out clues in the environment and helps the player learn the controls and advance in the game. Most of her hints are about how to progress in the story or defeat enemies. She can also be used to lock onto enemies, items and other characters in the game. She is one of the few characters with any voice-acting in the series, and one of the few characters who uses English words, such as \"Hey\", \"Look\", \"Listen\", \"Watch out\", and \"Hello\". Navi leaves Link at the end of the game after he puts the Master Sword back in the Pedestal of Time. In The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, Link sets out to search for a \"beloved and invaluable friend,\" which leads him into the land of Termina. It is strongly implied this friend is Navi.\nGamesRadar editor Mikel Reparaz ranked Navi as the most irritating female character, writing that she would have been bearable if she did not interrupt the game constantly with \"Hey!\" and \"Listen!\". Fellow GamesRadar editor Tom Goulter listed her as the second most annoying sidekick ever.\n\nOld Man\nThe Old Man is a character in multiple titles in the series, notably the original Legend of Zelda. He is a bald man with a red robe and white beard. Link can usually find him inside dungeons or caves standing between two torches. The Old Man has several functions, commonly giving Link items or advice. He is known for his vague advice, such as \"DODONGO DISLIKES SMOKE\", some of which was corrected in later releases of the game. He appears later in The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons (2001). In The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017), Link encounters an old man early in the game who is later revealed to be the deceased King of Hyrule, King Rhoam Bosphoramus Hyrule.\nIGN ranked him number five on its list of the Top 20 Weirdest Zelda Characters. His expression, \"IT'S DANGEROUS TO GO ALONE! TAKE THIS\" from The Legend of Zelda is a popular Internet meme that has been included in a list of the most repeated video games quotes compiled by GamesRadar.\n\nPrincess Hilda\nPrincess Hilda is the princess of Lorule in The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds and Zelda's counterpart.\n\nRavio\nRavio is a mysterious merchant and supporting character in The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds. After Link fails to stop Yuga from abducting Seres from the sanctuary, Ravio saves him and brings him back to his house. After Link awakens, he grants Ravio permission to stay in his house. Ravio sets up his shop and gives Link his bracelet, which prevents the hero from being turned into a painting by Yuga and allows him to traverse walls. Initially, Ravio will only rent items to Link and will send Sheerow to retrieve any rented items should Link fall in battle. He begins selling off his wares after Link finds the Master Sword and will thank Link for allowing him to make enough Rupees to retire early if every item in his shop is purchased.\nAfter Yuga and Princess Hilda are defeated and Princess Zelda is freed, Ravio enters Lorule, where it is revealed that he is Link's Lorulian counterpart. A servant of Hilda's, Ravio did not agree with her plan to steal Hyrule's Triforce. He was afraid to stand up to them (in contrast to Link's courageous attitude), so he fled Lorule, hoping to find a hero who could stop Hilda and Yuga. He successfully convinces Hilda that stealing Hyrule's Triforce would only bring out the worst in Lorule, which was exactly the scenario their forebears had hoped to avoid when they destroyed it. The two see Link and Zelda off as they return to their own world. After Link and Zelda wish to restore Lorule's Triforce, Ravio and Hilda are seen in the Sacred Realm of Lorule as the clouds part and their Triforce is restored.\nRavio wears a purple outfit with a rabbit mask covering his face, likely referencing when Link was transformed into a rabbit upon entering the Dark World in A Link to the Past. When unmasked, he looks exactly like Link except his hair is parted to the left instead of the right and is black instead of brown or blonde. He also has a pet bird named Sheerow, who retrieves any items Link rented if Link is defeated.\nRavio is a playable character through downloadable content in Hyrule Warriors. He wields the Rental Hammer as his primary weapon and has been slightly redesigned to resemble the Hyrule Warriors incarnation of Link in both size and body proportions.\n\nSages\nThe Six Sages are a group of individuals destined to aid a chosen hero in times of crisis; as such, they possess varying magical powers and responsibilities. Each era has its own group of sages, and those groups often aid Link in different ways (though only after they are rescued).\nThe Six Sages (originally called \"Wise Men\") are first mentioned in A Link to the Past. The in-game story reveals that during the great Imprisoning War fought between the evil Ganon and the Knights of Hyrule, the Seven Sages combined their powers to banish the wicked sorcerer and seal him in the Sacred Realm; Ganon's corrupt heart then warped that region into the Dark World. After a few centuries, the wizard Agahnim appeared and placed spells on the King of Hyrule and his knights, bringing them under his control. Agahnim gathered the Six Maidens\u2014the descendants of the original Sages\u2013including Princess Zelda herself\u2014and leached from their power to break the seal to the Dark World to resurrect Ganon. Link, after defeating Agahnim, journeyed across the Dark World to free the Seven Maidens, who used their combined strength to open the way to Ganon's Tower, the final dungeon of the game. After defeating Ganon and making a just wish on the Triforce, Link returned the Maidens to the Light World.\nIn the Ocarina of Time prequel, the story of the Sages from A Link to the Past is expanded; this was the first title in the series to refer to the group as \"Sages.\" In this era, the Six Sages are the protectors of the Triforce and the Sacred Realm; the original Sages built the Temple of Time and established various special locks to prevent evildoers from entering that sanctuary. Exactly what happened to the original Sages is unknown; by the time of that game, there is only one remaining. When Ganondorf uses Link to bypass the Sages' protection and steal the Triforce for himself, his dark heart corrupts the Sacred Realm and sends evil power throughout five temples in Hyrule, transforming the world into a dark mirror of its former self. To save the kingdom, the powers of the Sacred Realm send out an \"awakening call\" to five special individuals, who are summoned to the temples to become the new Sages and thus break the curses on the holy sites. Link's quest throughout the second half of the game is to cleanse the five temples of monsters and allow the Sages to perform their duties, weakening Ganondorf's power and strengthening the group to perform a banishing ritual. The Sages of this era are:\n\nRauru \u2013 A Hylian high priest and the Sage of Light; he is the last of the ancient Sages. He cares for Link during the hero's temporary imprisonment in the Sacred Realm and provides him with information about the Sages and the events of the past seven years. Rauru tasks Link with finding the five remaining Sages and gives him the Light Medallion to begin the quest.\nSaria \u2013 A Kokiri girl and the Sage of Forest; she was one of Link's only childhood friends. When monsters seized the Kokiri Forest because of to Ganondorf's curse, Saria traveled to the Forest Temple to solve the problem herself. After Link defeated the ghostly Phantom Ganon, Saria awakened as a Sage and used her new powers to break the spell, freeing the forest from evil influences and ushering in a new era of peace.\nDarunia \u2013 Leader of a tribe of rock-eating giants known as Gorons, and the Sage of Fire; he considers Link a \"Sworn Brother\" after Link helps his people by defeating King Dodongo, who had taken over the Goron's mines causing a food shortage. Seven years later, the Gorons resisted Ganondorf's rule after he took over Hyrule; as punishment, he captured nearly all of them and prepared to feed them to the monstrous dragon Volvagia in the Fire Temple. Darunia traveled to the Temple to free his people and briefly met Link inside. After Link freed the Gorons and slayed Volvagia, Darunia awakened as a Sage and added his power to Link's. Darunia returns as a playable character in Hyrule Warriors.\nPrincess Ruto \u2013 A Zora and the Sage of Water; she is the Princess of the Zora people. The Zora refused to follow Ganondorf's rule, so he punished them by sealing their entire domain in ice. The mysterious Sheik saved Ruto and traveled to the Water Temple to break Ganondorf's curse. Ruto met Link, whom she was engaged to as a child due to a misunderstanding and showed him the way through the temple. After Link killed Morpha, the source of the curse, Ruto awakened as the Water Sage and reluctantly put her marriage on hold to aid him. Ruto returns as a playable character in Hyrule Warriors.\nNabooru \u2013 A Gerudo and the Sage of Spirit; she is the second-in-command of the Gerudo tribe, a race of thieves. Nabooru protested Ganondorf's cruelty toward innocents and traveled to the Spirit Temple to interfere with the wizard's plans, recruiting Young Link to recover a rare pair of Silver Gauntlets for her. Unfortunately, Twinrova, Ganondorf's surrogate mothers, kidnapped Nabooru and brainwashed her into becoming his follower. After Link defeated the witches, Nabooru awakened as a Sage and delighted in the prospect of vengeance against her captors.\nImpa \u2013 This incarnation of Impa is a Sheikah, Zelda's nursemaid, the Sage of Shadow, and the founder and leader of Kakariko Village. When Bongo Bongo broke free and attacked the village, Impa traveled to the Shadow Temple to reseal the monster. Link went to the temple to assist her and defeated Bongo Bongo, allowing Impa to awaken as the Sage and join the group.\nZelda \u2013 Zelda is ultimately revealed as the Seventh Sage, who leads the rest of the group. After removing her disguise as the Sheikah ninja Sheik, she is captured by Ganondorf and brought to his Tower; the Six Sages aid Link by undoing the barriers the wizard established to protect himself. After defeating Ganondorf and escaping the tower, Link and Zelda found themselves fighting Ganon, who is revealed as a monster Ganondorf becomes when he uses the Triforce of Power. After Link incapacitates Ganon, Zelda calls upon the Six Sages, who combine their powers, open the door to the Sacred Realm, and seal Ganondorf away.The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker reveals the existence of a new group of Sages (though the Sages from Ocarina of Time appear as stained-glass windows in the basement of Hyrule Castle) responsible for keeping the evil-repelling power in the Master Sword by praying to the gods in their temples. After being resurrected, Ganondorf immediately attacked those temples and killed their Sages, thus robbing the blade of its magical abilities and protecting himself from it. Link meets the ghosts of these original sages and is tasked with finding their descendants, bringing them to their respective temples, and restoring the power to repel evil to the Master Sword. The Sages of this world are:\n\nMedli: A young Rito girl and the Sage of Earth, she is the apprentice attendant of Valoo, a powerful dragon and the Sky Spirit. When not serving Valoo, she tends to young Prince Komali and practices her harp, the symbol of the Sage of Earth. Her ancestor Laruto, a Zora, was the original Sage; Laruto teaches Link the Earth God's Lyric and appears to Medli in a vision to inform her of her sacred duty. Medli travels to the Earth Temple with Link, helps him navigate it, and eventually begins offering up her prayers, which restores the energy and edge of the Master Sword. She later reappears as a downloadable player in Hyrule Warriors.\nMakar: A young Korok and the Sage of Wind, he is one of the beloved children of the Great Deku Tree. During the annual Seeding Ceremony, Makar performs a special song on a leafy cello, the symbol of the Sage of Wind. His ancestor Fado, a Kokiri and the original sage, teaches Link the Wind God's Aria to awaken Makar to his destiny. Though Makar is captured in the Wind Temple, Link frees him, and he assists Link and fully restores the power to repel evil to the Master Sword, which manifests as a brilliant glow.The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess establishes a completely different group of Sages, despite taking place relatively soon after the events of Ocarina of Time; this disparity has never been fully explained, although the book Hyrule Historia reveals there are three distinct timelines branching out from the events of Ocarina. These Sages are a group of identical-looking elderly men who are made out of light, and wear Kabuki-like masks, and the keepers of the prison known as Arbiter's Grounds. They attempted to execute Ganondorf for his crimes, but the Triforce of Power gave him immortality, and the wizard killed the Sage of Water and claimed their execution weapon, the Sword of the Sages, for his own. The remaining five Sages used the Mirror of Twilight to banish Ganondorf to the Twilight Realm to protect themselves and Hyrule. During the game's events, the Sages reveal themselves and this story to Link, tasking him with finding the shards of the shattered Mirror to reopen the passage to the Twilight Realm and gain power there to defeat Ganondorf and his minion Zant. The Sages are also the ones who announce Link's companion Midna as the Princess of the Twili people.\nAnother group of Sages appears in The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds; they appear to be descendants of the Seven Sages from Ocarina of Time. In this era, the Sages' chief duty is protecting the Triforce of Courage from the forces of darkness, as only their combined power can reveal its hiding place. After the mysterious kingdom of Lorule loses its own Triforce due to a ferocious war, the passionate but misguided Princess of the realm, Hilda, decides to have her minion Yuga kidnap the Seven Sages and use their power to assemble Hyrule's Triforce that she might take it for herself. Yuga does this by turning the Sages into paintings, which are used for a ritual which summons Ganon and binds his Triforce of Power to Yuga himself; the sorcerer also kidnaps Zelda and siphons her Triforce of Wisdom. Hilda, pretending to be Link's ally, instructs the hero to gather the Six Sages' paintings, free them, and convince them to grant him the Triforce of Courage, which would give her control of all three pieces. The Sages of this era are:\n\nGulley: A young boy and the son of Hyrule's Blacksmith, he is a friend of Link's, who in this time period is the Blacksmith's apprentice. Gulley wears green, loves animals, and spends much of his time outdoors, implying a connection to the Sage of Forest. His youthful enthusiasm is unbounded, though he is confused about his powers, referring to himself as a \"Sixsage.\"\nRosso: A stout, strong man and a miner who works on Hyrule's Death Mountain. He befriends Link and gives him the Power Glove to allow him to lift rocks. Rosso's red hair, somewhat inhuman features (including pure black eyes), and ties to rocks imply a connection to the Gorons, and thus the position of the Sage of Fire. Humorously, after being restored, Rosso reveals that he has always known about his sagely duty\u2014he simply never bothered to mention it.\nOsfala: A prideful young man and the apprentice of Sahasrahla, Elder of Kakariko Village. Osfala arrogantly assumed himself to be the hero destined to save Princess Zelda and tried to challenge Yuga head-on, only to fail miserably and be transformed into a painting. After Link frees him, Osfala apologizes, acknowledges Link as a true hero, and agrees to help summon the Triforce. His yellow clothing and white hair tie him to the Sage of Light.\nIrene: An apprentice witch (she boasts of being the \"best witch of her generation\", despite being the only witch in that generation). She is told by a fortune teller to \"take care of green,\" and takes this to mean Link, who wears green clothing. Though caustic, she considers Link a friend and is eager to help him as one of the Sages. It is suggested that she is a descendant of the Sage of Spirit.\nOren: The Queen of the Zora. Link initially helps her when her Smooth Stone is stolen, causing her to overflow with power and bloat to a massive size. After being restored to normal, she goes for a swim, only to be kidnapped by Yuga. She praises Link as among the best humans she knows and urges him to defeat Yuga, so she may return to her people. As a Zora, she is descended from the Sage of Water.\nSeres: A nun in Hyrule's Sanctuary and a gentle soul. Seres is the first of the Sages to be transformed into a painting, an action Link witnesses firsthand; he travels to Princess Zelda to tell her about this action, which spurs his quest. After being saved from the forces of darkness, she sincerely thanks Link and promises to help him however she can. She has no apparent connection to any  element, which suggests that she is a descendant of Zelda herself.\nImpa: Zelda's loyal handmaiden, who in this incarnation is an elderly woman. She immediately believes Link's warnings about Yuga and agrees to help the young hero on his quest. Despite her courage, though, Yuga still transforms her into a painting and uses her in his evil rituals. As she is the \"latest\" Impa, she is likely this generation's Sage of Shadow.\n\nChampions\nThe Champions appear in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity. They consisted of four of the best warriors of the races across the land and were formed by Princess Zelda and the King of Hyrule to combat Calamity Ganon. They had the duty of piloting the Divine Beasts and assisting Link in delivering the final blow to Ganon. One hundred years prior to the events of Breath of the Wild, they were killed by the Blight monsters Ganon created to take control of the Divine Beast and the Guardians to devastate Hyrule. The Champions remained powerless for a century until Link freed the Divine Beasts from Ganon's influence, allowing them to complete their task.\n\nMipha: The empathetic Zora Champion and pilot of the elephant-like Vah Ruta. A beloved Zora princess, Mipha was King Dorephan's daughter; she possessed unique healing abilities not shared by others of her race. She was Link's childhood friend and created a suit of Zora Armor to be given to Link, for whom she held romantic feelings, but did not get a chance to present the armor to Link before her death. While her father and brother were aware of her feelings for Link, she kept them secret from her mentor Muzu due to his prejudice against Hylians. She grants Link \"Mipha's Grace'', which revives Link once his heart meter depletes. Voiced by: Amelia Gotham\nDaruk: The courageous Goron Champion and pilot of the salamander-like Vah Rudania. Although usually calm, he becomes loud and ferocious during battle and believes in Link's fighting capabilities. He grants Link \"Daruk's Protection'', which protects Link from attacks. Voiced by: Joe Hernandez (English); Kouji Takeda (Japanese)\nRevali: The prideful Rito Champion and pilot of the bird-like Vah Medoh. Revali is skilled in aerial battles and has exceptional sight and archery skills. He believes himself to be superior to Link in every way and finds it insulting that Link is the chosen one to stop Ganon instead of him, He changes his views on the Hylian hero after Link frees his spirit from Calamity Ganon. He grants Link \"Revali's Gale\", a powerful vertical wind column that blows Link into the air. Voiced by: Sean Chiplock\nUrbosa: The Gerudo Champion and pilot of the camel-like Vah Naboris, Urbosa is a strong and courageous leader who showcases care and concern for Princess Zelda's well-being because she was good friends with Zelda's mother, the deceased Queen of Hyrule. Urbosa still feels bitter about her failure as a Champion one hundred years before. However, she expresses personal pleasure in being able to help defeat her people's shame (as one of Ganon's previous incarnations was a Gerudo himself). She grants Link \"Urbosa's Fury\", a devastating electric attack.In the present-day setting of Breath of the Wild, Link meets new allies from each of the Champions' respective races who help him in entering each Divine Beast and freeing them from Ganon's control. In Age of Calamity, they are summoned from the future to save the Champions from being killed by the Blight Ganons.\n\nSidon: Mipha's younger brother and heir to the Zora throne, Sidon is admired by the Zora for his strength and optimism. Link is invited by Sidon to stop Vah Ruta from flooding Zora's Domain and causing terrible damage to the surrounding regions, as the Zoras (being weak to electricity) can't use the Shock Arrows needed to disable the Divine Beast. Sidon also helps Link win the support of the prejudiced Muzu by proving Mipha's love for him with the Zora Armor. A younger version of Sidon is briefly seen in a flashback during the Champion's Ballad DLC, and again in Age of Calamity where he bravely stands up to a Lynel despite the danger. Voiced by: Jamie Montellaro (English); Kousuke Oonishi (Japanese)\nYunobo: A young Goron and a descendant of Daruk. Though a bit cowardly, Yunobo possesses Daruk's power of Protection and helps Link enter Vah Rudania by using it to become a cannonball powerful enough to disable the Divine Beast. In Age of Calamity, Yunobo can eat special Rock Roasts to change the effects of his Protection when he attacks. Voiced by: Joe Hernandez\nTeba: A Rito archer known for his great skill in combat but also his intense focus and temper. With the Rito unable to fly freely for fear of getting shot down by Vah Medoh, Teba intends to attack the Divine Beast by himself with no regard for the consequences. Teba agrees to let Link join him on the attack after seeing his skill in midair archery, drawing the Vah Medoh's attacks away so Link can disable it and climb aboard. Voiced by: Sean Chiplock\nMakeela Riju: The current chief of the Gerudo, having taken the throne at a very young age after her mother's death. Though respected by the Gerudo, Riju feels her age and inexperience prevents her from being the ideal queen. Link wins her support by retrieving the Gerudo's treasured Thunder Helm from the Yiga Clan, which she uses to deter the lightning from Vah Naboris so Link can disable and board it. In battle, Riju rides on a shield pulled by her favorite sand seal Patricia.\n\nTerrako\nTerrako is a small egg-like Guardian, a type of Ancient Sheikah robot, who appears in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity. He was activated by Princess Zelda with a Blessed Screw when she was younger and became her companion after her mother died, but King Rhoam took him away from her and she soon forgot about Terrako over the years. When Calamity Ganon awakens and destroys Hyrule Castle, Terrako reactivates and opens a portal into the past, where it is found by Link and Impa during a monster invasion outside the castle. The Sheikah researchers learn that Terrako possesses knowledge of the future and use it to better prepare themselves against the Calamity. Terrako's presence allows Hyrule to alter the course of history for the better, such as preventing the Champions' deaths and awakening Zelda's latent powers before Link is critically wounded.\nUnnoticed by all, a portion of Calamity Ganon's Malice follows Terrako into the past and possesses the original Terrako before it activates, becoming known as Harbinger Ganon and using its knowledge of the future to manipulate the seer Astor into bringing about the Calamity. Once Astor is no longer needed, Harbinger Ganon absorbs his power and sheds his prior form to become the fully-powered Calamity Ganon, and Terrako sacrifices itself by smashing into Ganon and rendering him vulnerable to damage. A series of post-game side-quests allow the heroes to gather parts to repair and reactivate Terrako, after which he becomes a playable character.\n\nTingle\nTingle is a eccentric middle-aged man who is obsessed with fairies and believes himself to be the reincarnation of one. He wears a green bodysuit and first appeared in Majora's Mask, where he was found floating around on a balloon selling maps.\nHe subsequently appeared in Wind Waker, first in a jail room located on Windfall Island, and then in a tall wooden tower, where again he acted as a map maker.\nHe has also appeared in Oracle of Ages, Four Swords Adventures and The Minish Cap.\nHe cameos in Phantom Hourglass as a poster, in Spirit Tracks, an almost shop figurine, and in Skyward Sword as a doll in Zelda's room at the Knight Academy. He is a playable character via downloadable content in Hyrule Warriors.\nTingle has gained some notoriety, being ranked first on IGN's list of weird Zelda characters and seventh, one place ahead of Navi, in Cracked.com's list of annoying video game characters. He has gone on to feature in his own games, including Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland.\nIn Twilight Princess, the character Purlo was designed as a more realistic version of Tingle.  He is similar in appearance, and shares Tingle's obsession with Rupees, but can be hostile and unfriendly.\n\nRecurring characters\nMany minor characters in the games have returned multiple times throughout the series, having Link in some form perform minor tasks for them.\n\nAgitha\nAgitha first appears in Twilight Princess. She is a cheery ten-year-old girl who calls herself the \"Princess of Bugs\" and lives in a house in Hyrule Castle Town. Agitha asks Link to help her collect twelve pairs of Golden Bugs for a ball she is having, with the promise of awards for his help. She returns in Hyrule Warriors as a playable character, armed with her parasol and using her golden bugs to fight for her.\n\nAnju\nAnju first appears in Ocarina of Time but is unnamed and generally referred to as the \"Cucco Lady.\" She resides in Impa's old house in Kakariko Village. She says that she is allergic to Cuccos, and hers are always escaping from their pen. The first time that Link rounds them up for her, he receives an empty bottle in return.\nMajora's Mask is the first Zelda game in which Anju is named. She is troubled over the disappearance of her fianc\u00e9, Kafei. In a lengthy side-quest resulting in the reunion of those betrothed, Link can acquire several masks: the Keaton Mask, the Kafei Mask, the Postman's Hat, and the Couple's Mask.\nAnju reappears in The Minish Cap, wherein she again employs Link's help to retrieve her Cuccos, compensating with rupees and a Piece of Heart.\n\nBeedle\nBeedle, also known as Terry in different localizations of the games, is a traveling merchant who sells Link numerous items to help aid him as well sometimes exotic items. He also values his consumers with rewards discounts. He first appears in The Wind Waker where he can be found around numerous islands in the Great Sea on his boat shop.\nIn The Minish Cap, Beedle appears in Hyrule Town selling Picolyte after Link fuses kinstones and clears the area with the Gust Jar.\nIn Phantom Hourglass, his role is the same as that in The Wind Waker, but he sells boat parts.\nIn Spirit Tracks his role is the same but instead of a boat, he is seen soaring above in a balloon across New Hyrule. Link must bring the boy from Aboda Village to Beedle to fulfill his dream of flying. Beedle agrees to have him on board. Link also has to obtain a Force Gem from Beedle.\nIn Skyward Sword his role is the same, traveling from his island home to Skyloft in a pedal-powered wooden shack with helicopter-type propellers that serves as his shop. He has a pet beetle that goes missing partway through the game; if Link retrieves it, Beedle offers him a permanent discount at his shop. If Link attempts to leave his shop without purchasing anything, Beedle expresses his annoyance before pulling a rope that drops Link through a trapdoor onto the ground below.\nIn Breath of the Wild, he travels on foot with a large backpack, and he is often seen at different stables.\nIGN ranked him number 14 on its list of the Top 20 Weirdest Zelda Characters.\n\nBiggoron\nBiggoron is a Goron who is approximately the size of a mountain. He first appears in Ocarina of Time, where he can be found sitting atop Death Mountain, scratching at his dry eyes. He has a brother named Medigoron who resides in the second level of the Goron city and will sell Link the Giant\u2019s Knife. At the end of a trading sequence, Link gives the giant special Eye Drops; in return, Biggoron makes the Biggoron's Sword, which is unbreakable and inflicts twice as much as damage as the Master Sword but prevents Link from using his shield.\nIn Majora's Mask, Biggoron has been cursed with invisibility by the Skull Kid, and sits at the far end of the narrow ridge which leads to Snowhead Temple, blowing gusts of wind to prevent anyone from traversing the path (which caused the Goron Darmani to fall off and die). Once Link learns the Goron Lullaby, he uses this to lull Biggoron to sleep, thus making the giant fall off the cliff and allow access to the Snowhead Temple.\nIn Oracle of Seasons, Biggoron can be found at the top of Goron Mountain, where he is suffering from a terrible cold. Link gives him some Lava Soup for this illness in exchange for the Goron Vase. Through a linked game with passwords, Link can tell Biggoron a password which then gives Link Biggoron's Sword.\nIn The Minish Cap, he resides in the mountains near Veil Falls, only appearing once Link fuses kinstones with a Goron in a cave near Lon Lon Ranch. The giant is hungry and asks Link for a shield to eat; when Link returns, after Biggoron has eaten, he presents Link with the Mirror Shield.\nIn Phantom Hourglass, Biggoron is not his usual monstrous size, but of normal Goron height\u2014though he remains the largest on Goron Island. Here he has a son named Gongoron. Link is required to answer his questions before being allowed to explore the island further.\n\nDamp\u00e9\nDamp\u00e9 is an old gravekeeper who appears in multiple games. He can be recognized by his pale skin and hunched back.\nHe first appears in Ocarina of Time where he can be found in the Kakariko Village graveyard. As Child Link he's usually inside his hut sleeping, but, at sunset, he appears outside for a few hours, where he provides a mini-game for Link to try to win a piece of heart. As Adult Link, Damp\u00e9 is dead and Link must enter his grave to claim the hookshot. Once inside, Damp\u00e9's ghost challenges him to a race. Link must follow him to obtain the hookhot without failing.\nIn Majora's Mask, he can be found in the Ikana Graveyard. During the day, he walks around outside. It takes an entire day, however, for him to return to his hut. If Link wears the Captain's Hat whilst talking to him, he gets scared and quickly rushes inside. On the final day, he can be found underground in the graveyard looking for a treasure which Link helps him find.\nIn Four Swords Adventures, he is found at the graveyard in the swamp area. Link can talk to him. He warns Link that he should not be out late and tells about the Forest of Light.\nIn The Minish Cap, he is found in the Royal Valley in western Hyrule where Link can fuse kinstones with him. He gives Link the Graveyard key.\nIn A Link Between Worlds, he appears as the graveyard's caretaker near the sanctuary.\n\nGreat Fairy\nGreat Fairies appear in all of the games, except for Skyward Sword, as giant fairies that reside in springs called \"Great Fairy's Fountains\". They are much older than other fairies, and are thus much more powerful. Most of those depicted wear dresses, full-length or knee-length, though in Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, Twilight Princess, and Breath of the Wild they are more risque. According to their figurine in The Wind Waker, they were born on the Angular Isles, and they are destined to aid the \"Great Hero\", Link. In all games, they will completely refill Link's health. In some of their appearances, they will reward Link with new items or upgrades of his items or meters, usually for merely visiting them, though sometimes he must complete a task. These tasks usually involve some selflessness on the part of the player. In Hyrule Warriors, one of Link's unlockable weapons allows the player to control a Great Fairy, with Link held in a bottle that she carries with her.\n\nGuru-Guru\nGuru-Guru is a bald, bearded man who's always seen playing the \"Song of Storms\" on what looks like an organ grinder. He first appears in Ocarina of Time where he's found inside the Windmill in Kakariko Village, happily playing away. In the future, he's angry because seven years ago a young boy played the Song of Storms with a magical ocarina, messing up the windmill. Unaware Link is that same boy, he teaches him the \"Song of Storms\", and Link returns to the past to fulfill his predetermined destiny, draining the well to access the next dungeon.\nIn Majora's Mask he's part of the Gorman Troupe set to play at the Clock Town Carnival. During the day he can be found playing in the troupe's room in the Stock Pot Inn. He's found at the Laundry Pool during the night because his playing annoys the other members greatly. Sometime before Link's arrival to Termina, he was a member of a different troupe, led by a dog. Out of anger and jealousy, he steals from the leader the Bremen Mask and gives it to the player after confessing his story. By wearing the mask and marching, Link can make some animals follow him, and is required to obtain the Bunny Hood by helping a flock of baby Cuccos reach adulthood as they march.\nIn Oracle of Seasons, he's found beside a windmill again in the Eastern Suburbs of Holodrum. Here, Link can trade him the engine grease for a phonograph to continue the trading sequence for the Noble Sword.\nIGN ranked him number 13 on its list of the Top 20 Weirdest Zelda Characters.\n\nHylia\nHylia, the goddess of light who was reborn as the first incarnation of Zelda, became the ancestor of the Hyrule Royal Family and was the namesake of the Hylians. She is depicted throughout the games by statues and imagery, often depicted as having angelic wings and holding a sword in her right hand.\n\nMalon\nMalon has appeared in several games in the series, and is almost always found at Lon Lon Ranch with her father Talon. Like the series' protagonist, Link, and its namesake, Princess Zelda, Malon is depicted with many varying incarnations. Her largest appearance is in Ocarina of Time, where she interacts with Link on various occasions when he visits the ranch. Link helps Malon and her father with their ordeals while she mainly raises Epona, and teaches Link Epona's Song, which can call the horse to Link at any time. In other games, she has smaller roles, involving Link helping Malon and Talon. If Link beats Malon's record of 50 seconds on an obstacle course on Epona, she will put a cow in his house in Kokiri Forest.\nIn Oracle of Seasons, she and her father breed Cuccos north of Horon Village near Eyeglass Lake in Holodrum. As part of the trading quest, if Link gives her the Cuccodex, she will give him the Lon Lon Egg.\nIn Four Swords Adventures, the four Links guide Malon to her father, Talon, when her path is blocked by castle knights. Upon reuniting her with Talon, he gives the Links permission to use his horses, which appear when one of the Links touch a carrot. She also makes an appearance in The Minish Cap, where Link helps her and Talon back into their house by finding a key, later moving to the town to sell Lon Lon Milk.\n\nMaple\nMaple is an apprentice witch serving under her grandmother Syrup. She first appears in Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages, frequently flying by Link on her broomstick. Upon crashing into Link, he and Maple will both drop their items, prompting a race between them to gather up as many of them as possible. As the game continues, Maple will upgrade her broomstick to a vacuum cleaner and, in a linked game, a U.F.O., each being faster and making the item races more challenging. Maple is also a part of the trading sequence in both games, as she seeks a Lon Lon Egg in Seasons and a Touching Book in Ages.\nIn the Game Boy Advance remake of A Link to the Past, Maple appears inside the magic potion shop as the salesclerk, replacing the unnamed shopkeeper character from the original version of the game. In A Link Between Worlds it is hinted that the witch who runs the magic shop is also named Maple, though it is unclear if she is meant to be the same character.\n\nMarin\nMarin is a young girl who appears in The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening. She finds Link washed ashore on Koholint Island and nurses him back to health, after which she spends her time in the village with her father Tarin. Marin is loved by the villagers for her singing, specifically her favorite song, the Ballad of the Wind Fish. During a side-quest in which Link must escort her to a neighboring village, Marin reveals that she desires to explore the world beyond Koholint Island. In the ''good ending'', if the player does not die during the entire game, the Wind Fish grants her desire by reincarnating her as a seagull.\nMarin appears as a trophy in Super Smash Bros. Melee. She is also a playable character through downloadable content in Hyrule Warriors Legends, in which she fights using the Sea Lily's Bell and by summoning the Wind Fish for wide-range attacks.\n\nMutoh\nMutoh is an old, short-tempered boss of a group of carpenters who are responsible for building structures around Hyrule and other lands. However, his employees are always either lazy or lost and he has to yell at them. He first appears in Ocarina of Time where during the present he is busy constructing a building in Kakariko Village. Seven years later in the future, they are found in Gerudo Valley where all the carpenters except Mutoh are captured by the Gerudo after a failed attempt at joining them. Link later has to help free them so they can escape. In this game only, he has two children, Anju and Grog.\nIn Majora's Mask, his carpenters are busy getting ready for the Clock Town carnival however Mutoh is busy arguing with the mayor to keep the carnival running. The guards are arguing and want to close the fair in fear that the moon will fall from the sky. On the Final Day, he is the only one found outside the clock tower; everyone else has fled. However, in the final scene, he is seen running towards Stone Tower.\nIn Oracle of Ages, he is responsible for building the bridge connecting Nuun Highlands to Symmetry City in Labrynna. However, all the carpenters have scattered across the highlands and he asks Link to find them so they can build the bridge.\nIn The Minish Cap, he is found in Hyrule Town where if Link fuses kinstones with him, the carpenters will construct houses for either Nayru, Din or Farore to live in. When not working, they are located in the sawmill in the town.\n\nSkull Kid\nSkull Kid is a young Imp who first appears in the Nintendo 64 video game The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. He is dressed in a red cloak and hat covering an underlayer of clothing. There are a few Imps that can be found in the Lost Woods, a maze-like forest. Two play a memory game with Link as a child, and one rewards him if he plays a particular song for him on his ocarina. However, if Link, as an adult, meets Skull Kid, he shall attack him out of fear. It is possible to defeat the Skull Kid; doing so rewards Link with 200 Rupees.\nIn the direct sequel, The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, the Skull Kid is seen cavorting with a pair of fairies named Tatl and Tael. He steals a mask called Majora's Mask which grants him great power but corrupts him. Under the influence of its power, he cursed many of the inhabitants of Termina, Link included, and caused the moon to fall toward Clock Town. He also treats Tatl and Tael poorly. He is thwarted when his old friends the Four Giants of Termina stop the moon from falling and Link defeats Majora. Afterward, Skull Kid befriends Link and reunites with his fairies as well as the Four Giants. At the end, the Skull Kid notes that Link \"smells a lot like that fairy kid who taught [him] that song in the woods,\" suggesting that he is the same Skull Kid as seen in Ocarina of Time.Skull Kid also makes an appearance in the Nintendo GameCube/Wii game, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess.  Skull Kid made a cameo appearance in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as a pair of stickers. He also appears in The Legend of Zelda manga. Soon after the events of Ocarina of Time, Link met the Skull Kid in the Lost Woods, who was one of the Skull Kids who work for the Baga Tree, the evil rival of the Deku Tree. Skull Kid appears as a playable character in Hyrule Warriors Legends and Cadence of Hyrule.\nThe character drew a positive reception from critics.  Screen Rant editor Jason Chamberlain ranked Skull Kid as one of the best supporting characters in the overall The Legend of Zelda series, saying that \"with [the] memorable cast of characters [of Majora's Mask], perhaps none of them are more memorable than the misunderstood 'villain' of the story, Skull Kid\", who \"[i]s essentially a lonely kid who los[es] his way\" in dealing with themes of resentment and abandonment. CBR noted that Skull Kid's characterization, in particular their depiction in The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask manga series, featured \"layers of depth unseen in games at the time\" and his motivations made him a superior antagonist compared to Ganondorf, \"[who] just craves power\", Bloody Disgusting praised the character's physical design in Majora's Mask, stating that \"[w]hat immediately stands out about Skull Kid is his mask; with its heart-shaped design, vibrant colors, and other eccentric features, the mask exudes a mystic appeal.\" IGN editor Lucas M. Thomas listed Skull Kid as a good addition for the video game Super Smash Bros. Brawl, when he was the first likely included amongst the other characters listed.Skull Kid's appearance in the 2016 short fan film Majora's Mask: Terrible Fate, voiced by Joe Zieja, receiving widespread attention among The Legend of Zelda fandom and critical acclaim.\n\nSyrup\nSyrup is a friendly old witch who first appears in Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages. She specializes in selling restorative potions and is Maple's grandmother. In Oracle of Seasons her shop is found in Sunken City in Eastern Holodrum where it can only be accessed during winter. During the quest for the Noble Sword, Link must trade her a Mushroom for a Wooden Bird, and she will not sell Magic Potions until she receives the Mushroom. In Oracle of Ages, her shop is located in Yoll Graveyard during the present in Labrynna. At one point, Link must use one of her Magic Potions to cure King Zora's illness.\nIn The Minish Cap, her shop is found in the Minish Woods. Link has to purchase from her the Wake-Up Mushroom for Rem the Shoemaker so to wake him up. At first, she only sells Blue Potions, but after Link fuses kinstones with a Minish in South Hyrule Field, she will then start selling Red Potions.\nThough not named, similar witches like Syrup appear in A Link to the Past and Link's Awakening. In A Link to Past she can be found in Eastern Hyrule outside her shop while her apprentice (Maple in the Game Boy Advance version) tends the shop itself. Link can find her a Mushroom from the Lost Woods which she can use to complete her potion and which Link can use. In Link's Awakening, the shop can be found in Koholint Prairie on Koholint Island. She asks Link to find the Sleepy Toadstool to make some Magic Powder to give to Link and instructs him to use it on unlit torches.\n\nTalon\nTalon is Malon's father and the owner of Lon Lon Ranch who first appears in Ocarina of Time. Link first finds him sleeping outside Hyrule castle. Link uses a cucco to wake him up and then hurries back to find Malon. Later, if Link heads to Lon Lon Ranch, he can participate in a mini-game to earn a bottle of milk. Also at the farm is his farmhand Ingo, who seven years later is given the ranch by Ganondorf, which forces Talon to stay at Kakariko Village. However, he returns once Link defeats Ingo in a horse race.\nIn Majora's Mask, in Termina (which is set in a parallel universe), Talon is known as Mr. Barten and is the bartender of the Milk Bar in Clock Town. On the Final Day, he does not leave the town over the falling moon and instead stays at the bar.\nIn Oracle of Seasons, his farm is found north of Horon Village, where he is again with Malon where they raise Cuccos. Talon is found sleeping at Mt. Cucco; if Link wakes him up with the Megaphone, he'll give him the Mushroom as part of the trading quest.\nIn Four Swords Adventures, he is seen briefly when Link returns Malon after rescuing her. He allows Link to use their horses by collecting carrots.\nIn The Minish Cap, he can be found at Lon Lon Ranch east of Hyrule Town where he has lost the keys to his house. However, Link is able to find the spare key by shrinking to help them get inside.\nIn Link's Awakening, a similar character named Tarin appears as Marin's father. Early in the game, Tarin is turned into a raccoon when he eats a strange mushroom in the forest and blocks Link's path until the transformation is undone with Magic Powder. Later, Link gives Tarin a stick as part of the trading sequence. He uses it to try and shoo bees away from a honeycomb but is chased off by the angry swarm, leaving Link to take the honeycomb.\nTalon bears a strong resemblance to the Nintendo mascot, Mario. He has a short stature, a large mustache, and wears a red shirt with blue overalls. Additionally, he and his daughter wear pendants that resemble Bowser, and his ranch hand Ingo resembles Luigi. In his official art for Oracle of Seasons, he wears a hat with Mario's signature \"M\".\n\nNotes\n\n\n== References ==",

    "Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus": "Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus is a 2022 action role-playing game developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo and The Pok\u00e9mon Company for the Nintendo Switch. It is part of the eighth generation of the Pok\u00e9mon video game series and serves as a prequel to Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl (2006), their enhanced version Pok\u00e9mon Platinum (2008), and their remakes Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl (2021). The game was first announced as part of the Pok\u00e9mon 25th Anniversary event in February 2021, and was released worldwide on 28 January 2022.\nThe game follows the protagonist, sent back through time, as they travel through the Hisui region based on the island of Hokkaido during early Japanese colonization. Centered around exploration of the region's several open areas populated with Pok\u00e9mon, the game's objective is to complete a roster of the region's Pok\u00e9mon, known as the Pok\u00e9dex. Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus received generally favorable reviews and was a commercial success, having sold over 12 million copies.\n\nGameplay\nPok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus is an action role-playing game that preserves the core gameplay of past entries in the main line series. The player is able to roam freely across the game map, divided into five large areas of individual biomes. Each time the player enters such areas, they spawn in a camp, and can fast travel to other camps in the same area. Outside of traversing the landscape on foot, the player can unlock rideable Pok\u00e9mon which can travel faster, swim across bodies of water, climb cliffs, or fly. In each area, Pok\u00e9mon wander the landscape, being found in certain habitats and will interact with both the player and their environments. Some will actively avoid the player while others act aggressively, and some exhibit other specific behaviors. A number of \"Alpha\" Pok\u00e9mon - larger, more powerful versions of the Pok\u00e9mon - can also be found in the areas. The multiple areas and the hub system instead of a fully open world gameplay resulted in reviewers comparing Legends: Arceus with the Monster Hunter series. Reviewers also drew comparisons between Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, noting apparent similarities in both gameplay and art style.Unlike in previous titles, the player character themselves can be attacked and harmed by wild Pok\u00e9mon. If enough damage is taken, he or she will fall unconscious and reappear at the base camp. Players can capture wild Pok\u00e9mon in the overworld without engaging in battle, though some must still be battled before being caught. Battles can be initiated by releasing captured Pok\u00e9mon near a wild Pok\u00e9mon. While the turn-based battle system of the prior titles are retained in the game, an additional feature is added which allows players to trade attack damage for more turns and vice versa. Outside standard battles, the game also introduces special boss battles where the player character has to dodge and attack powerful Pok\u00e9mon, regular turn-based battles being included during the fights as opportunities to stun the bosses.By battling, capturing, or engaging with other interactions with Pok\u00e9mon, players obtain progress in completing their Pok\u00e9dex entries. Players can also take on and complete side quests given by NPCs in the game. In total, the game featured 242 Pok\u00e9mon on release, including 7 new species and 17 new iterations (\"forms\") of existing Pok\u00e9mon. At the start of the game, three starter Pok\u00e9mon are available: Rowlet (from Sun and Moon), Cyndaquil (from Gold and Silver) and Oshawott (from Black and White). Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus is the first mainline game to feature starter Pok\u00e9mon from different regions together. While players could trade Pok\u00e9mon online, Legends: Arceus does not feature multiplayer battles, unlike previous installments in the series.\n\nPlot\nSetting\nThe game is set in a bygone era of the Sinnoh region's history, when it was known as the Hisui region, long before the events of Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl and their remakes take place. Hisui is based off the real-life island of Hokkaido during the Muromachi period, when it was still known as Ezo, with new settlers from other regions interacting with natives in a parallel with the interaction between Hokkaido's Ainu people and Japanese settlers. Ainu groups are represented in the game by the Diamond and Pearl clans, while new mainland settlers are represented by the Galaxy Expedition Team.The vast majority of the region is covered in sparse, open wilderness populated with wild Pok\u00e9mon, with only one significant settlement in addition to a number of small campsites. Unlike in the setting of previous Pok\u00e9mon games, Pok\u00e9mon are treated as wild animals or forces of nature instead of as companions or partners. Pok\u00e9 Balls in the game are made of \"Apricorn\" fruit and puff steam when a Pok\u00e9mon is caught, instead of being presented as high-tech devices like in previous installations, while the Pok\u00e9dex is a paper notebook.\n\nStory\nThe game begins with the player speaking with a disembodied voice, identified as Arceus, which tasks the player with encountering all Pok\u00e9mon in the Hisui region before transporting the player there through a rift in spacetime. The player is found by Pok\u00e9mon researcher Professor Laventon, who brings the player to a local settlement named Jubilife Village. There, the player is recruited into the Survey Corps of the Galaxy Expedition Team, a group which that has arrived in Hisui to chart and study the region. After receiving their starter Pok\u00e9mon, the player proceeds to travel in the Hisui region to complete the Pok\u00e9dex. Throughout the player's journey, the spacetime rift they had been transported through results in several powerful \"noble Pok\u00e9mon\" venerated by the local Diamond and Pearl clans turning berserk through powerful lightning, forcing the player to engage them in battles using 'balms' to calm them down.\nAfter the player defeats five noble Pok\u00e9mon, the spacetime rift begins to worsen rather than calm down as per the Galaxy Team's expectations and the sky becomes a scarlet colour. Blamed for the instability, the player (who came through the same rift) is banished from Jubilife Village and forced to travel the region again to address the cause of the rift. Working with either the Diamond or Pearl clans and under the care of a researcher of myths called Cogita, the player travels to the three major lakes of the region to encounter legendary Pok\u00e9mon Azelf, Mesprit and Uxie, the three Pok\u00e9mon that, once the player pass their trials, provide material to craft the Red Chain needed to stop the rift. After defeating the Galaxy Team's leader, Commander Kamado at the summit, the player reaches the peak of Mount Coronet: The Temple of Sinnoh, at the centre of the region. Depending on the clan the player worked with, either Dialga (Diamond clan) or Palkia (Pearl clan) appears first, breaks the Red Chain, and is caught by the player before their enraged counterpart emerges. Using the fragments of the Red Chain, a special Pok\u00e9 Ball capable of capturing the other legendary Pok\u00e9mon is crafted, and the player successfully battles and captures it, sealing the spacetime rift.\nIn the post-game, the player teams up with Volo, a member of the Gingko Guild merchant group who assisted the player throughout the game, to seek out all of the Plates associated to Arceus. The player can encounter a number of other legendary Pok\u00e9mon, each one holding a Plate. Going to the Temple of Sinnoh for the last plate, Volo betrays the player and attempts to steal the Plates from the player to draw out Arceus and subjugate it to make a new world, also revealing he allied himself with Giratina to open the spacetime rift in a failed attempt to drive out Arceus, sending the legendary caught at the end of the game mad. The player defeats both Volo and Giratina, securing the plates and transforming the player's Celestica Flute item into the Azure Flute. Once all other Pok\u00e9mon (excluding Shaymin and Darkrai, which are only obtainable through other means) have been captured, the player can play the Azure Flute at the Temple of Sinnoh to encounter Arceus. After the player proves themselves in battle, Arceus gifts them with an incarnation of itself, so that it may explore the world that it created by the player's side.\n\nDevelopment\nPok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus is the first known project by Game Freak in the action role-playing subgenre. It was first revealed in the Pok\u00e9mon Presents on 26 February 2021 alongside Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl as part of the Pok\u00e9mon 25th Anniversary celebration. According to the developer, it serves as a \"premake\" to Diamond and Pearl. A free content update, Daybreak, was announced and released on 27 February 2022.\n\nRelease\nThe game was released worldwide on 28 January 2022. Exclusive in-game and physical bonuses were given out to those who pre-ordered the game digitally or physically. In Japan, those who pre-ordered Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus received a gold holographic artbook along with a limited edition Arceus promotional trading card.\n\nReception\nCritical reception\nPok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus received \"generally favorable reviews\", according to review aggregator Metacritic. Andrew Webster of The Verge praised the game's overhaul of the Pok\u00e9mon formula, particularly the world design and Pok\u00e9dex challenges, writing that it was \"the biggest overhaul to the Pok\u00e9mon formula since the series debuted\". Despite criticizing the battle system, Ryan Gilliam of Polygon liked the open world and how simple catching Pok\u00e9mon was compared to previous entries, saying: \"It's so easy and fluid to just grab a Pok\u00e9mon and add them to my party while I'm exploring the game's verdant fields or snowy tundra\".Jordan Middler of Nintendo Life praised Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus for its \"rewarding\" exploration, \"addictive\" catching mechanics, quality of the Pok\u00e9mon roster, and its \"genuine sense of scale\", while stating that \"Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus is quite simply one of the greatest Pok\u00e9mon games ever made\". Jessica Scharnagle of Dot Esports stated that many of the tedious mechanics and forced activities in prior games were better simplified or removed to give the players more freedom in gameplay, while criticizing the game's performance.Chris Tapsell of Eurogamer enjoyed the new animations and art for the Pok\u00e9mon in Arceus, saying \"The way wild Pok\u00e9mon, more vibrantly animated here than in any previous game, are all hops, rolls, lumbers. All splashes, naps, growls, and waddles. The way they exist so unelaborately but with so much personality is such a simple treat\". Andrew Cunningham of Ars Technica disliked the graphical style and lack of new Pok\u00e9mon, but felt the battle system and open world exploration mixed well together, saying: \"And when the battle is over, you can go right back to exploring or catching other Pok\u00e9mon, with no pauses for level-ups or learning moves [...] once you learn the ropes, it's easy to lose yourself in the rhythm of sneaking, catching, battling, and exploring\". Tom Regan of The Guardian praised the exploration and the changes in gameplay compared to earlier entries in the franchise, saying: \"For arguably the first time since the series began, everything feels fresh, and thrillingly unpredictable\", but criticized the quality of the game's visuals, comparing it unfavorably to that of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Xenoblade Chronicles 2.\n\nSales\nAs of 31 March 2022, the game has sold 12.64 million copies. Nintendo reported that the game sold 6.5 million copies worldwide within a week of release, outpacing other Nintendo Switch Pok\u00e9mon titles such as Sword and Shield and Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl.In Japan, it sold 1.42 million physical copies within three days, and another 645,000 throughout February to top sales charts in both months. It sold 125,851 units in March, making it the second best-selling game of the month (below Kirby and the Forgotten Land).In the United States, Legends: Arceus (excluding digital downloads) was the best-selling video game in January 2022. It was the second best-selling game the following month and sixth in March, making it the second best-selling game during the first quarter of 2022 (second only to Elden Ring).\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website (US)\nOfficial website (in Japanese)",
    "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild \u2013 Creating a Champion": "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild \u2013 Creating a Champion is a companion art book to Nintendo's 2017 video game The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It was published in English by Dark Horse Comics on 20 November 2018 and is a localisation of a book titled Master Works that was published by Nintendo in Japan. It presents official illustrations and concept art from the game alongside development notes and also documents the fictional history of Hyrule presented in the game. The book was released as a standard edition with a white cover, a \"Hero's Edition\" featuring a blue cloth slip case and a \"Champion's Edition\" collector's box with a leather case.\n\nContent\nCreating a Champion comprises 424 pages of content that focus entirely on The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. The book features 296 pages of concept art alongside notes by the development team. It includes 50 pages of official illustrations by Takumi Wada and features interviews with Satoru Takizawa, Hidemaro Fujibayashi, Wada-san, and Eiji Aonuma. The book also includes a 55-page section devoted to the game's fictional history.The book reveals concepts and early designs for Breath of the Wild, such as Eiji Aonuma's idea to include Link's motorcycle, the Master Cycle Zero, in the game, which was initially rebuffed but eventually accepted by the team. It shows how each Divine Beast was designed and modelled to represent an identifiable animal. It also presents rough designs for characters and enemies, some of which were not included in the final game, such as, \"a design for a giant, fortress-like Guardian that was equipped with multiple beam cannons\".Creating a Champion diverges from previous Zelda art books in relation to The Legend of Zelda fictional timeline. This chronology was first revealed in print in an earlier Dark Horse publication titled Hyrule Historia, which sets down where each Zelda game is positioned within the timeline. In Creating a Champion, producer Eiji Aonuma explains why Breath of the Wild's position on the timeline has not been clarified by stating, \"We want players to be able to continue having fun imagining this world even after they are finished with the game, so, this time, we decided that we would avoid making clarifications.\"\n\nDevelopment\nCreating a Champion is a localisation of a book titled Master Works, which was published by Nintendo in Japan. The game's assets were documented by Nintendo and the publisher Ambit. Dark Horse was responsible for the translation of Master Works and its localisation for an English-speaking audience.Dark Horse editor Patrick Thorpe stated that he approached the fictional history section of the book \"like an archaeologist\", as it all had to be fact-checked for accuracy. He commented, \"So I warped all over the map, scouring the most obscure regions of the game to make sure that our text was accurate. I\u2019ve been a Hyrule historian. This time I was a Hylian anthropologist.\"Thorpe stated that the regular edition of Creating a Champion was designed with a white cover to represent Hylia, the goddess at the centre of Zelda lore. This was particularly important to Thorpe, as the publication of the book followed three Dark Horse art books that were designed in the colours of the three Golden Goddesses in the Zelda series named Farore, Din and Nayru. He explained that the two special editions were mocked up by Cary Grazzini over a single weekend and were each designed to have a specific focus. The Hero's Edition was created to focus on Link and its cloth cover was designed to represent his tunic. By contrast, the Champion's Edition was created to honour the Champion characters in the game.\n\nPublication\nDark Horse published Creating a Champion as a hardcover companion art book to Breath of the Wild. Prior to publication, the book was announced by Nintendo on Twitter on 10 July 2017. Nintendo also revealed several sample images from the book. Creating a Champion was preceded by the publication of earlier Zelda art books published by Dark Horse, beginning with Hyrule Historia in 2013 and Art & Artifacts.The standard edition of the book was released alongside a deluxe edition on 20 November 2018. The deluxe \"Hero's Edition\" was published with a slip case designed with the same blue colour as Link's tunic and includes a map of Hyrule, a glass replica of a spirit orb and a photo illustration of Link and the Champion characters.A \"Champion's Edition\" was also released as a collector's box and features a leather case with gold embellishments. The box includes the Creating a Champion art book with gold gilded pages, a Calamity Ganon tapestry, an art print of an illustration of the Champions created by Takumi Wada, six small prints of the characters Zelda, Link, Mipha, Revali, Daruk, and Urbosa, and four orbs that display a laser etching of a Divine Beast symbol. The book was made available as an exclusive release at GameStop.\n\nSales\nPublishers Weekly ranked Creating a Champion in 15th position for hardcover nonfiction in the first week of its release, with over 10,000 units sold.\n\nReception\nRob Dwiar writing for GamesRadar+ included the book on a list of best video game art books describing it as, \"a stupendous companion to one of the best games of recent times\". Sara Gitkos of iMore included the book on a list of best Legend of Zelda books for 2022. Chris Carter of Destructoid reacted to the lack of clarity with regards to the positioning of Breath of the Wild on The Legend of Zelda fictional timeline. He thought that Nintendo's decision to leave this open to the player's interpretation suggested that it was still undecided and that the timeline was considered by Aonuma to be a mistake. Eurogamer's Tom Phillips described the lack of clarification as a \"cop out\" but continued, \"perhaps it's the best kind of cop out - one which strengthens the game and the discussion around it, rather than restricting fan enjoyment.\"\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website (Dark Horse)",
    "Impa": "Impa is a recurring fictional character in Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda series. She is one of the oldest and most frequently recurring characters in the series, having appeared in six titles of The Legend of Zelda games and several spin-off games. She has been redesigned in a variety of forms over the years, but her role has always been to take care of Princess Zelda either as a nursemaid or guardian, and act as a guide to the hero, Link. Impa is also a member of the Sheikah, a mysterious ninja-like group in the lore of the series that is skilled in combat and magic. She first appeared in the instruction manual for the original 1986 action-adventure video game The Legend of Zelda, then made her debut as a major character in the 1998 action-adventure game The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. She has since appeared in several titles in The Legend of Zelda series, including Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages, Skyward Sword, A Link Between Worlds and Breath of the Wild. She also appears in several spin-off games, including Hyrule Warriors and Cadence of Hyrule. Her most recent appearance was in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity in 2020. Impa has received a positive reception for her representation as a strong female character and also for her role in the narrative and lore of the Zelda series.\n\nConcept and creation\nIn a foreword to Hyrule Historia, The Legend of Zelda game creator Shigeru Miyamoto revealed the origins of the series, including Impa's role in the game's lore. He stated, \"Impa, Link, and Zelda were the guardians of the Triforce. Today, when you think of characters who are connected to the Triforce, you think of Link, Zelda, and Ganon, but that started in Ocarina of Time.\" He also explained that Impa's name originated in her early role as a female storyteller, as her name was taken from the word \"impart\".\n\nCharacter design\nImpa's character design has evolved significantly over the course of The Legend of Zelda series. She has been depicted in a variety of forms and ages to fulfill various roles in the games. In her first appearance, Impa was created as an elderly woman for the instruction manual of The Legend of Zelda. In Ocarina of Time, she appears as a slimmer, younger character with a sturdy build and hair tied back in a pony tail. By contrast, she was designed as an overweight woman for Oracle of Seasons. In Skyward Sword she appears as younger and older versions of the same character due to the storyline shifting in time and is dressed in the clothing of the Sheikah. The younger version of Impa was given an androgynous appearance. The older version wears a costume that was designed to reflect the passage of time, including a pendulum braid and a triangular robe that becomes a sundial. In Breath of the Wild, she reappears as a much older village elder with a short, shrunken stature. In Hyrule Warriors she is depicted as an athletic warrior, which is similar to her appearance in Ocarina of Time. In Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity she is portrayed as a young woman in her twenties who is a powerful fighter and a younger version of the character that appears in Breath of the Wild. Impa's design, abilities, and gestures in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity drew heavy inspiration from Naruto Uzumaki, the eponymous character of the manga Naruto.Throughout her many incarnations she bears the typical traits of the Sheikah tribe, having white hair and red eyes. She also typically displays the Sheikah symbol, an eye with three triangles above and a teardrop below, on her forehead or clothing. As a representative of her people, she wears the unique garments of the Sheikah, which take inspiration from historical Japanese clothing. As a member of the Sheikah, Impa is highly skilled in combat and in the use of magic.\n\nPortrayal\nImpa is voiced by Rei Shimoda in Skyward Sword, and by Aki Nagao in Hyrule Warriors. In Breath of the Wild and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, Impa is voiced by Shoko Tsuda in Japanese, and Andi Gibson in English. In Cadence of Hyrule, she is voiced by Jo Krasevich.\n\nCharacteristics\nImpa plays a prevalent role in the lore of The Legend of Zelda series, being a member of the Sheikah tribe, a recurring group of mysterious guardians that protects the Royal Family of Hyrule, particularly Princess Zelda. Impa's main role throughout the series is to mentor Link during gameplay and act as a guardian to Zelda. She plays a divinely ordained role as a member of the Sheikah that extends across the series. In the lore of the series, the Sheikah are commanded by the goddess Hylia to protect Zelda's bloodline. Impa is often significantly older than Zelda and Link so that she can offer her experience as royal advisor.\n\nAppearances\nThe Legend of Zelda series\nImpa is one of the oldest characters in The Legend of Zelda series, having been present at its beginning. She made her first published appearance in 1986 with the release of The Legend of Zelda, which was the original video game in The Legend of Zelda series. Although she does not appear in the video game, she features in The Legend of Zelda Instruction Booklet, in which she acts as a guide to the hero, Link. The manual introduces the storyline of the antagonist Ganon seeking to plunge the world into darkness. To protect Hyrule, Princess Zelda splits the Triforce of Wisdom into eight fragments and hides them throughout the kingdom. She commands her nursemaid, an elderly woman named Impa, to seek out \"a man with enough courage to destroy the evil Ganon\". When Ganon discovers this, he imprisons Zelda and sends out a search party for Impa. When Impa is cornered by Ganon's henchmen, Link appears and saves her. She tells him about the history of Hyrule and sends him to recover the eight fragments so that he can defeat Ganon.For the second installment of the series, which is titled Zelda II: The Adventure of Link (1987), Impa reappears in the game instruction book. After Link wakes up with a strange mark on his hand, he seeks out Impa, Zelda's nursemaid, who is \"shocked and frightened when she saw the birthmark\". She escorts him to a sealed door in the North Castle, known as \"the door that does not open\". The manual asserts that only the descendants of the Impa family who have served the king know how to open the door. Impa presses Link's left hand to the door, which causes it to open. Behind the door lies Princess Zelda, who has been placed in a magical slumber. Impa recounts the history of Hyrule to Link and gives him six crystals and a scroll that reveals the secrets of the Triforce. She implores Link to save the princess by assembling the Triforce and bringing back peace to Hyrule.Impa makes her first prominent appearance as a major character in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (1998). After Link is sent by the Great Deku Tree to Hyrule Castle and discusses the imminent threat of Ganondorf with Zelda, he meets Impa, who acts as a guide to Link and a protector of Zelda. She helps Zelda to escape before Ganondorf enters the Sacred Realm and obtains the Triforce of Power. In this incarnation, Impa is remarkably different from her previous appearances as the weak old lady and nursemaid to Zelda. She is instead introduced as the last of the Sheikah tribe and the village elder. She also acts as Zelda's bodyguard and mentor. Although she spends little time in gameplay, her influence on the storyline is evident throughout the game. Her role in the narrative is to be the Sage of Shadow, one of the Sages that Link must find in order to defeat Ganondorf.In the twin titles of The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages (2001) Impa appears as Zelda's nursemaid and helps her on her adventures in Labrynna and Holodrum, but plays only a minor role in gameplay. In the storyline of Oracle of Seasons, she takes on the disguise of a cook to protect Din, but fails and leaves the mission to Link. In Oracle of Ages, she makes several appearances in the game to help Link find secret passages.InThe Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword (2011), Impa was reintroduced after a decade to play a major role in the storyline. The game reinforces the importance of the Sheikah in the lore of the series, with Impa being the only representative of the Sheikah in the game. She appears in both a young and old form as the game moves through time. In this incarnation, Impa has a divine mission to travel to her future in order to protect Zelda, who is the reincarnation of the Goddess Hylia, and defeat the main antagonist, the Demon King Demise. At the end of the game, Demise is defeated and trapped inside the Master Sword. After this event, Impa reveals that she is a member of the Sheikah tribe, one of \"the goddess's chosen guardians\" and that her role is to ensure the safety of the sword and the Triforce and prevent Demise's return. She suggests that her divinely ordained role extends across generations by stating, \"You and I will surely meet again someday.\"Impa is also present in The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds (2013). In this game, she reappears as Zelda's nursemaid in 2D form. In the storyline, she is kidnapped and turned into a painting by the main antagonist, Yuga.Impa plays a major role in the gameplay of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017). She appears in the form of a village elder and member of the Sheikah tribe who Link encounters upon arrival in Kakariko Village. In this incarnation Impa is a much older, shrunken version of her younger counterpart in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity. Her age is about 121 years, since Link has been asleep for 100 years before the storyline begins. This version of Impa has a granddaughter named Paya, who appears to be roughly the same age as Link. She also has an older sister named Purah, who runs the Hateno Ancient Tech Lab. \"Seek Out Impa\" is the first major quest line that Link receives after completing the initial starting area on the Great Plateau. She tells Link the story of the four Divine Beasts and helps him to unlock his lost memories of the past. After finding all 12 memories, Link returns to Impa, who reveals the location of Link's last memory. The final memory depicts a cutscene in which Zelda unlocks her powers to protect Link and eventually leads to the player recovering the Master Sword.\n\nSpin-off games and other series\nImpa appears alongside Link and Zelda in one of three Zelda video games released in 1993 for the CD-i, titled Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon. In the storyline, Zelda and Impa travel to Gamelon to search for Link and King Harkinian after they go missing.Impa makes a major appearance in the hack-and-slash video game Hyrule Warriors (2014) as a playable character. In the storyline, she leads the Elite Guard and has an agile set of acrobatic moves during gameplay as the Hyrulean Captain. During gameplay, she wields a Giant Blade or a naginata. Impa is the first character to be unlocked as a recruit, a trend that is repeated in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity and reflects her status within the franchise.In Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity (2020), Impa appears as a much younger version of the same character that appears in Breath of the Wild, as the game acts as a prequel with events taking place 100 years earlier. Her age can be approximated to about 20, due to a statement in the book titled The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild \u2013 Creating a Champion, which asserts that Impa is around 120 years old in Breath Of The Wild. Her role is to be a royal advisor and member of the Sheikah tribe who joins Link and Zelda in their fight against Calamity Ganon. During gameplay, Impa has a unique action that she uses in battle, which involves creating shadow clones of herself to help her to attack surrounding enemies. Her signature weapons include the Kakariko Kodachi, Faithful Kodachi and the Devoted Kodachi. In contrast to her role in earlier games as mentor to Zelda, Age of Calamity changes the dynamic of Impa's relationship with Zelda by making them close friends.Impa is one of several Zelda characters that was introduced as a playable character in the first DLC pack for the rhythm game Cadence of Hyrule in 2020. She also appears as a Spirit in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.\n\nReception\nOver the course of her appearances, Impa has received a generally positive reception from critics and fans. She has been the subject of various fan comics, fan art and memes. She has also been praised for her role as a strong female character. Allison Stalberg for The Gamer ranked Impa in tenth place on a list of \"The 10 Strongest Women In The Legend Of Zelda Series\", commenting that \"She is a fan-favorite character from the latest Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity title.\" Melody Macready for Screen Rant ranked Impa in eighth place on a list of \"10 Most Powerful Female Characters\" in The Legend Of Zelda, commenting on her evolution over the years and stating, \"she is always depicted as a stoic but loyal friend of the royal family who will give her life for Zelda.\" She also commented on her role as warrior stating, \"Nintendo would revitalize Impa into Princess Zelda's bodyguard, and she would become a fearsome warrior that would give the Amazons from Wonder Woman a run for their money.\" Kristy Ambrose for The Gamer ranked Impa in sixth place on a list of \"10 Strongest Warriors In RPG History\", commenting that Impa is one of the Sheikah people that, \"train as warriors and serve as protectors for the royal family, and Impa is the culmination of that tradition.\" Clare McBride for SyFy Wire commented on Impa's legacy by stating, \"What's fascinating to me about Impa is that she gets to be, well, a little bit of everything over the last 30-odd years. She gets to be the warrior and the respected village elder and the crone\" and opined that she \"truly understands and values her power and her duty. And to me, that\u2019s the best and greatest measure of a warrior woman.\"Impa has also been noted for her role in the narrative of Zelda lore. Sara Heritage for The Gamer ranked Impa in sixth place on a list of every side character in Breath of the Wild, commenting on her role as a member of the Sheikah tribe that has \"guided and protected Link and Zelda throughout their adventures\". Callum Archer for The Gamer ranked every incarnation of Impa, describing her as an \"amazing woman\", and considered that her appearance in Skyward Sword is her largest and most important role, commenting, \"She sends Link to her older self who, in turn, sends him to enhance the Goddess Sword with the three Sacred Flames and turn it into the Master Sword, the blade that would be instrumental in the story of just about every Zelda game in the series canon.\" Madeline Carpou for Screen Rant also chose Skyward Sword as Impa's standout moment, because \"she literally transcended time, space, and divinity to protect the princess.\" Jake Koran for Screen Rant suggested that Impa should be included in downloadable content for Mario Kart 8, due to the fact that she has appeared in many games and has gained increased popularity following the releases of Breath of the Wild and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity. Kyle Gratton for Screen Rant summed up Impa's importance in relation to the other main characters in The Legend of Zelda series, by stating \"Inextricably linked to the eternal struggle of Zelda's Hyrule Kingdom are four characters: Link, Zelda, Ganon, and Impa [\u2026] All four of these recurring characters are directly connected to the Goddess Hylia, and are instrumental in every Zelda entry's narrative, practically defining the series in and of themselves.\n\nSee also\nCharacters of The Legend of Zelda\n\n\n== References ==",

    "Eiji Aonuma": "Eiji Aonuma (Japanese: \u9752\u6cbc \u82f1\u4e8c, Hepburn: Aonuma Eiji, born March 16, 1963) is a Japanese video game designer, director, and producer. He works for Nintendo as the project manager of their The Legend of Zelda series. Aonuma is also one of the deputy general managers of Nintendo's Entertainment Planning & Development division, having served that role since 2019.\n\nCareer\nAonuma graduated from the Tokyo University of the Arts in 1988 with a masters degree in composition design, working on marionettes. After graduating, he was interviewed at Nintendo. Aonuma met Shigeru Miyamoto during the interview, and showed Miyamoto samples of his college work. He landed a job at Nintendo without ever having played a video game before. He asked his girlfriend about video games, and she introduced him to two Yuji Horii games, Dragon Quest (1986) on the Famicom and The Portopia Serial Murder Case (1983) on the PC-8801, which were the first video games he ever played.His first projects involved graphic design, creating sprites for Nintendo Entertainment System games such as 1991's NES Open Tournament Golf. Aonuma was director of development on 1996's Marvelous: M\u014dhitotsu no Takarajima for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. In a move which Aonuma attributes to his position on the Marvelous team, Miyamoto recruited Aonuma to join the development team for the Zelda series. He spent several years as a lead designer of The Legend of Zelda series: The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and its sequel Majora's Mask, both for the Nintendo 64; and The Wind Waker, the first Zelda game for the GameCube. After The Wind Waker, he considered moving onto other projects, but was convinced by Shigeru Miyamoto to continue with the Zelda series.Aonuma then led the production of The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, the second major Zelda game to be released for the GameCube and a launch game for the Wii. He then produced a sequel to The Wind Waker for the Nintendo DS, The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, followed by another Nintendo DS title, The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks. He also produced Link's Crossbow Training and The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword for the Wii, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds for the Nintendo 3DS, and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild for the Nintendo Switch and Wii U. In November 2016, Aonuma received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Golden Joystick Awards.In addition to producing Zelda games, Aonuma plays percussion as a member of a brass band he founded with five others in 1995, known as The Wind Wakers, named after the game of the same name. The band comprises over 70 Nintendo employees who perform four concerts a year. In June 2019, he was promoted to the position of deputy general manager within the company's Entertainment Planning & Development division.\n\nWorks\nReferences\nExternal links\nEiji Aonuma at IMDb\nEiji Aonuma's profile at MobyGames",
    "The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword": "The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is a 2011 action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo for the Wii. A high-definition remaster of the game, The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD, was co-developed by Tantalus Media and released for the Nintendo Switch in July 2021.\nTaking the role of series protagonist Link, players navigate the floating island of Skyloft and the land below it, completing quests that advance the story and solving environmental and dungeon-based puzzles. The mechanics and combat, the latter focusing on attacking and blocking with sword and shield, are reliant on the Wii MotionPlus peripheral. A mainline entry in The Legend of Zelda series, Skyward Sword is the first game in the Zelda timeline, and details the origins of the Master Sword, a recurring weapon within the series. Link, a resident of a floating town called Skyloft, sets out to rescue his childhood friend Zelda after she is kidnapped and brought to the surface, the abandoned lands below the clouds.\nDevelopment lasted around five years, beginning after the release of Twilight Princess in 2006. Multiple earlier Zelda games influenced the developers, including Twilight Princess, Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask. Many aspects of the game's overworld and gameplay were designed to streamline and populate the experience for players. The art style was influenced by the work of impressionist and post-impressionist painters, including Paul C\u00e9zanne. The implementation of Wii MotionPlus proved problematic for the developers, to the point where it was nearly discarded. It was the first Zelda game to use a live orchestra for the majority of its tracks, with music composed by a team led by Hajime Wakai and supervised by Koji Kondo.\nFirst revealed in 2009, it was initially planned for release the following year before being delayed to 2011 to further refine and expand it. The game was a critical and commercial success upon release, receiving perfect scores from multiple journalistic sites, winning and receiving nominations for numerous industry and journalist awards, and selling over three million copies worldwide. The 2021 remaster sold a similar number on the Nintendo Switch. Feedback on the game later influenced the development of the next entry for home consoles, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.\n\nGameplay\nThe Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is an action-adventure video game in which players take on the role of series protagonist Link through a series of overworlds populated by monsters and navigating dungeons featuring puzzles and further enemies including dedicated bosses. Link is controlled using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, and the Wii MotionPlus expansion device is required to play. The greater majority of gameplay mechanics revolve around use of motion controls: these include camera control with the Nunchuck and general hotkey actions and movement linked to the Remote. Jumping across gaps and scaling ledges happen automatically within context. The Nunchuck is also used to make Link perform a forward roll. In addition to his standard pace, Link can sprint for short distances. Sprinting and other actions such as climbing and carrying heavy objects is limited by a stamina meter, which recharges after a few seconds when not performing actions that drain it. When depleted entirely, Link's movement speed is reduced and he is left vulnerable until the metre refills. Standard navigation takes place from a third-person perspective, while the Dowsing search function switches to a first-person view: Dowsing scans an area for a selected object, with new Dowsing objectives appearing depending on game context.Fighting enemies, which appear in both the overworld and dungeons, relies on Link's use of his sword and shield. Link's sword movements are mapped to the direction the Wii Remote is flicked by the player, and other moves include a forward thrust and a stab. Enemy movements are designed to anticipate and block Link's combat movements. By raising the Wii Remote, the sword gathers energy which can be unleashed in a Skyward Strike. Skyward Strikes are also used to trigger environmental elements such as magical switches. The shield is controlled with the Nunchuck: when the shield is raised, it can be used to reflect attacks. Spin attacks and Finishing Blows are activated by swinging both the Wii Remote and Nunchuck. Link's health is represented with Hearts, with Link taking damage whenever he is hit: if he loses all Hearts, the game ends.The game is set on the floating island of Skyloft and surrounding airborne islands, and the three Surface overworlds where the majority of the main adventure takes place. Side quests for the town's citizens are unlocked as the game progresses. The different areas of the Surface are accessed through portals in the clouds. Side quests for characters of the Surface are also available and are sometimes mandatory for completing the main quest. The sky is navigated with a Shoebill-like bird called a Loftwing, while the Surface is navigated on foot. Beacons can be set on the map for Link to follow, and save points in the form of statues preserve Link's progress up to that point. During his quest, Link is aided by the sword spirit Fi, who can give hints to the player for both environmental elements and enemies: for example, when an enemy is targeted and Fi is summoned, she will give the enemy's characteristics and weaknesses.Traditional series items such as Bombs used for demolition and the Bow and Arrow for ranged attacks are available as Link progresses through the game, along with new additions such as a mechanical Beetle that flies to areas beyond Link's reach for a variety of actions including activating switches: and a whip for grabbing otherwise-unreachable objects and levers. Some items and equipment will degrade and eventually break depending on their use, such as the shield taking damage when blocking fails. Items and equipment can be optionally upgraded using materials gathered from defeated monsters and within each overworld environment. In addition to consuming resources, Link must also pay for the upgrade with Rupees, the game's currency which is scattered throughout the world.\n\nPlot\nSkyward Sword takes place at the beginning of the Zelda continuity: according to legend, three ancient Goddesses bestowed a great wish-granting power: the Triforce. The Demon King Demise, a deity who had conquered time itself, laid waste to much of the land seeking to take the Triforce. The Goddess Hylia gathered the survivors and sent them into the sky, allowing her to launch a full-scale offensive against Demise. She was victorious, but the land was severely damaged. Uncounted years later, the outcrop is known as Skyloft, and its people believe the surface below is a myth.In the present, knight-in-training Link passes his final exam despite attempted interference by his class rival Groose, who considers himself a romantic rival for Link's childhood friend Zelda. After passing the exam and on a celebratory flight together, Zelda is whisked away below the clouds by a dark tornado. After recovering back on Skyloft, Link is led into the island's statue of Hylia to the Goddess Sword by Fi, the spirit of the sword who resides within it. Link draws the sword, showing himself to be the prophesied hero who will finally destroy Demise. Opening a way through the clouds to the surface, Link is guided by Fi to the Sealed Temple, where he meets an old woman who tells him to track Zelda: this leads Link across the regions of Faron Woods, Eldin Volcano, and the Lanayru Desert. While he catches up with Zelda, he is prevented from returning her to Skyloft by Impa, a young woman guarding and guiding Zelda. Link also encounters Ghirahim, a self-proclaimed Demon Lord working towards freeing Demise. At the Temple of Time in the Lanayru Desert, Link defends Zelda and Impa from Ghirahim, buying the two enough time to depart through a Gate of Time into the past, which Impa destroys as they pass through.\nReturning to the Sealed Temple, Link is followed by Groose and the two end up on the surface together. Link then has to defeat the Imprisoned, a monstrous form of Demise attempting to reach the Sealed Temple, after the old woman shows him a second, albeit dormant, Gate of Time. With the Imprisoned defeated, Link sets out to strengthen the Goddess Sword by passing trials set by the ancient Goddesses and using their gifts to find Sacred Flames to purify and strengthen the blade so the Time Gate can be awakened. Returning to find the Imprisoned attempting to break free, Link reseals it with help from Groose. Activating the Gate of Time and traveling to the past, he finds Zelda and learns that she is the mortal reincarnation of Hylia; Hylia could not kill Demise and was too weakened from their battle to fend him off again, so she created the Goddess Sword and reincarnated as a mortal to find someone who would fulfill her duty by using the Triforce to wish Demise's destruction, as only mortals can use the artifact. Zelda then seals herself inside a crystal to strengthen Demise's seal, granting her power to the Goddess Sword and upgrading it into the Master Sword.Link locates the Triforce on Skyloft and uses it to destroy Demise. With Demise dead, Zelda is freed, but Ghirahim arrives and kidnaps Zelda: though Demise is dead in the present, Ghirahim intends to use Zelda as a sacrifice to resurrect him in the past. Link pursues Ghirahim into the past and fights through his army. He then defeats Ghirahim, who turns out to be the spirit of Demise's sword but is unable to prevent Zelda from being used to reincarnate Demise's humanoid form. Groose guards Zelda's body while Link challenges Demise: Link triumphs and absorbs Demise's essence into the sword, but not before Demise curses Link and Zelda's bloodlines to be haunted by his reincarnated rage. To complete the sword's seal, Link drives it into a pedestal in the Sealed Temple, with Fi accepting eternal slumber as a result. Groose, Link and Zelda return to their time while Impa remains behind and destroys the Gate of Time, as she is a person of that time and must watch over the Master Sword. In the present, the old woman greets them one last time before she dies and vanishes, revealing that she was Impa. The game ends with the surface now freely accessible to the residents of Skyloft, while Zelda decides to remain there to watch over the Triforce; she and Link together establish the kingdom of Hyrule.\n\nDevelopment\nSkyward Sword's development began in 2006, after the release of The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess for GameCube and Wii. It was developed by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development, a development division of series publisher Nintendo. They were assisted in development by the Kyoto branch of Monolith Soft. Its producer was Eiji Aonuma, a major contributor to the Legend of Zelda series. His main preoccupation during these early stages was whether the developers could continue creating The Legend of Zelda games using the same development mindset that had been used up to Twilight Princess. The game's director was Hidemaro Fujibayashi: previously working as assistant director on The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass for the Nintendo DS, Skyward Sword was his first project for home consoles. He began work on Skyward Sword after finishing Phantom Hourglass, and continued working on the game alongside his work on The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks. When Spirit Tracks was finished, Fujibayashi and the game's development team transferred back to working on Skyward Sword.According to Aonuma, the team's starting point for development was the Wii version of Twilight Princess: feeling they had not fully realized their goal of creating a vast and realistic world with Twilight Princess, they used their previous work as a foundation for the next game. They also sought to create a memorable experience equivalent to The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, by that time considered the series' most memorable game. Development lasted around five years, and according to series producer Shigeru Miyamoto, the game's budget was considered quite high for a Nintendo project. The development time was initially estimated at three years, but difficulties and changes in the game's development extended development time by a further two years: despite this, Miyamoto felt that this was not wasted development time as the first two years went into experimentation. By June 2011, the game was complete aside from fine-tuning and balancing its mechanics.\n\nScenario\nThe script for cinematic scenes was written by Naoki Mori, who joined the project for one and a quarter years in his role: the cinematic director was Shigeki Yoshida, who was brought on at the same time as and worked on the storyboards with Mori. The initial script was proposed by Fujibayashi based on his perception of the game's structure. As the game's theme was the use of the sword, and the sword most associated with the series was the Master Sword, the team decided to make it an origin story for the weapon. An early element was whether to incorporate the creation of Hyrule, while also needing to explain the creation of Skyloft: this initial stage of story development ended up being difficult as their initial story plans were full of contradictions to established series lore due to them wanting to create an origin story for the entire series. These issues were further complicated by the third year of development with the necessity of finalizing the gameplay and environments. Feigning illness, Fujibayashi shut himself away in a hotel room and wrote the synopsis in a single day. Mori wrote the dialogue based on Fujibayashi's synopsis, who needed to work out the fine details with Fujibayashi. A scene Fujibayashi was intent on including was where Zelda jumped from the edge of Skyloft and Link caught her: this was fitted in for the two characters after the end of Link's exam. The early part of the story was quite different from earlier Zelda games, playing out in a similar way to a school drama. Once the script was finished, it was handed to Yoshida so his team could create the cinematics. The total number of cinematics was estimated as 79, coming to over 120 minutes.The relationship between Link and Zelda was quite different from earlier incarnations, in particular the fact that Zelda was not royalty. According to Aonuma, a recurring difficulty was how contrived the necessity for Link to rescue Zelda became with each passing installment, as their contact may only have been fleeting beforehand. In response to this, the team considered how to make the player care about Zelda and want to rescue her. Having the two characters as childhood friends served this purpose and cut down on extraneous plot elements. They continued to encourage the player by having Link only just miss her on her early travels across the Surface. Mischievous elements were also added to Zelda's personality by her pushing Link over a ledge: initially intended as a rule of three-style gag, it was cut down to two during development. The figure of Hylia was a new addition to the world's lore, although her existence was linked to Zelda, with the two being essentially the same character known under different names in subsequent ages. Groose, who acted as Link's rival, was introduced to make the story more interesting within the school setting. Groose's maturation during the story was intended to help convey Link's parallel growth as a character as he was otherwise mute and static.Fi was created before the implantation of Wii MotionPlus when she was going to be part of some different undefined gameplay concepts unrelated to motion control. Her design was based on the design of the Master Sword, referencing her origins as the sword's spirit. She also served as an alternate explanatory voice as Link was a silent protagonist. According to staff, Fi's technical dialogue for each area of the game was written by different people, verbal inconsistencies arose that needed addressing, so Fujibayashi adjusted them all so she sounded consistent. Nearly all of Fi's dialogue was ultimately written by Fujibayashi. Ghirahim was designed to be similar to the Dark Link character from Ocarina of Time: he could read Link's movements, requiring players to think strategically to defeat him rather than simply swinging Link's sword around randomly. Character designs were far more detailed than in previous Zelda games. Clothing was frequently designed to complement backgrounds, such as Zelda's pink and red dress in the opening. The game's use of warm colors and brushstroke-like aesthetics was inspired by impressionist artwork, pioneered in the 19th century by painters such as Claude Monet: a particular element cited by Miyamoto was the sky, which he called a tribute to post-impressionist Paul C\u00e9zanne's work. The basic starting point for the art style was that it was a fantasy world. The final version was referred to as a balance between the cartoon styling of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and Twilight Princess, where the cartoon shading was transferred onto an older version of Link. The team settled this art style as it would properly portray the more exaggerated actions of some characters and general swordplay while preserving Link's mature appearance.\n\nDesign\nDuring development, the team faced a lot of problems when designing the game so it would be both familiar for series fans and fresh to old and new players. The pieces of gameplay experimentation meant that the development was \"a more fundamental ground-up process\" than earlier games such as The Wind Waker. Their earlier games had involved lifting elements from earlier games and pasting them into a new entry, but for Skyward Sword the developers wanted to add a new play structure to avoid fans seeing it as more of the same. The original concept for gameplay using the Wii MotionPlus was proposed by Fujibayashi at a point when the team was already developing the gameplay around the console's standard Wii Remote and Nunchuk control scheme. When first proposed, Aonuma was highly enthusiastic, and his wish to change to Wii MotionPlus meant that work on the game needed to begin all over again. The use of Wii MotionPlus proved challenging for the developers to implement, to the point where at one point Aonuma seriously considered dropping it from the game entirely. After the release of Wii Sports Resort, the team saw how motion controls could be used for swordplay: after talking with the development team, they were able to borrow the technology and used it to create the motion-driven swordplay. The implementation of Wii MotionPlus meant that the enemy artificial intelligence needed to be able to counter it, adjusting their stances depending on the position of Link's sword.When creating Link's sword movements, the team initially wanted them to be as realistic as possible, but because it was detrimental to the character's portrayal, they had to include unrealistic movements to preserve the atmosphere. The Skyward Strike was initially born from Aonuma thinking up a possible mechanic of holding the sword above Link: these also gave rise to the game's title. Having sword fighting relying on Wii MotionPlus freed up other buttons on the controller, allowing the addition of the Dash sprinting option. So as not to interrupt the flow of gameplay, they incorporated other elements into the Dash function, such as scaling walls rather than just slamming into them. The Dowsing mechanic was created early on, based on the gameplay themes of discovery and exploration. Due to the introduction of Dowsing, the team did not have to create environmental landmarks for places and objects of importance as they had done in previous games. So players would not get lost in the terrain, they also introduced the marker beacons. Items were designed so they could be visible in any area, such as the bright blue Bombs. They were also designed based on their original location: those from Skyloft used a bird motif, while those from other Surface regions used more intricate designs. The Beetle acted as a replacement for the boomerang, as the team wanted an item that players could control. The Beetle and other pseudo-technical items gave rise to the ancient mechanical theme that appeared in the Lanayru Desert region. At Miyamoto's insistence, the more desirable items that were normally placed towards the end of a campaign were made available to players from an early stage. When designing items, the developers were faced with the usual problems of the interdependence of items and dungeons creating a chicken-and-egg scenario for the developers. The menu for Item access was also redesigned around the use of Wii MotionPlus.In past Zelda games, the team had made numerous new fields for player exploration, but this time they limited the number of overworlds to three and expanded their content so players would be able to fully appreciate them through repeated visits. The team also created the world based on their experiences with Twilight Princess: feeling that the overworld and dungeons were too large with puzzles too thinly dispersed, the team both sought to compact areas and have environmental puzzles in the overworld. The biggest difficulty was ensuring that players could reach areas quickly while still discovering new features and puzzles. The creation of the Skyloft overworld was due to difficulties connecting the three Surface-based overworlds due to drastically contrasting environments. The sky was initially going to be presented similar to the course selection screen from the Super Mario series, but this was changed to an overworld with its own quests and population so Link had a place where he could prepare for his adventures. An initial idea, when jumping down from the sky seemed unlikely to be approved, was to have a huge tower acting as a central hub, with the height at which Link jumped lengthening the duration of his free fall. Once the concept of traveling from the sky had been chosen instead, the Loftwing mounts were created so it looked and felt more rational to players. These overlapping gameplay mechanics triggered the creation of Skyloft, along with elements of the early game such as the Knight Academy. The continual movements and routines of Skyloft's people were modeled after similar time-driven mechanics from The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, with similar links between character-specific side quests and the main narrative. Despite the aerial element, the mechanics necessary for free navigation meant a Loftwing racing minigame could not be implemented.Each Surface overworld had a specific theme: the forest overworld revolved around landforms altering gameplay, the volcano overworld focused around changing the rules of gameplay, while the desert overworld was themed around duality between past and present. The first areas, the Sealed Grounds and Faron Woods, were created so players could be eased into the game's mechanics and navigation. While the forest areas were made to be mostly flat, the Eldin Volcano overworld was made with height differences in mind to provide a greater challenge. Elements in the volcano terrain included areas of lava and slopes where Link's sprinting ability would become necessary for reaching new areas. For the Lanayru Desert, the team created three different overworld zones due to its unique time-shifting mechanics, triggered with Time Shift stones: this shifting between different zones was inspired by similar systems in Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess. The portable Time Shift stones were one of many ideas included in the desert overworld as they did not fit with the forest or volcano environments. A difficult feature to include naturally was the remnants of Lanayru's Ancient Civilization, which used electricity to power both its technology and citizens. Enemy types that recurred in all Surface-based overworld areas were given slightly altered designs so they would be unique to each overworld. The Silent Realms were created as a new mechanic, filled with enemies that could not be defeated and relying on Link's sprinting ability rather than his weapons or items. While they had experimented with indestructible enemies in Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks, but this time it was changed by restricting Link's options and actions. They also created a time limit for added strategy, as knowledge of the areas where the Spirit Realms were located was key to completing them. This was also why they were set up in areas players would already be familiar with. They were originally in the form of special dungeons, but this was discarded in favor of the familiar areas.\n\nAudio\nThe game's sound team consisted of ten people: five handling general sound design, and five handling music composition. Hajime Wakai acted as the game's sound director and lead composer, with the other composers being Shiho Fujii, Mahito Yokota, and Takeshi Hama. Longtime series composer Koji Kondo had a supervisory role, only composing a single piece by himself: the music accompanying the prologue video describing the mythical origins of Demise and Hylia. He also helped in arranging the other composer's pieces, using an electric piano and a Mac computer. Fujii was responsible for the music focused on environments, dungeons, boss battles: among her work was the music for Skyloft. She used art and environmental assets so that her compositions would fit in with their environments. A first for the Zelda series, the music was performed using a live orchestra rather than synthesized instruments. It was the first time Nintendo EAD had used a live orchestra. Any previous orchestral elements in Twilight Princess, which amounted only to one track, were handled by their Tokyo division. Due to his experience, the department's musical lead Yokota was brought on to help orchestrate the score. Aonuma initially did not think of using an orchestra and was still sure the score would remain synthesized even after Wakai asked him about it. An orchestra was finally chosen after Miyamoto insisted upon it, a decision which surprised the entire team.Using the orchestra enabled a greater expression of emotion, which meant that they used it when creating scores for environments, cinematic scenes, and emotional moments within the story. Conversely, the team was given less freedom to adjust tracks as they had been able to with synthesized tracks. Something new they did for Skyward Sword was producing unique themes for specific characters such as Link and Zelda. They also added people singing songs, another element new to the series. One notable element was the game's main theme \"Ballad of the Goddess\", which was a retrograde version of the recurring tune \"Zelda's Lullaby\". Due to the use of an orchestra and the sheer amount of extra work going into the sound design, the music team doubled in size from the standard five-person group, and became the largest sound team at the time to have worked on a Nintendo game. The positive reception of the orchestral score within the company led to the creation of  The Legend of Zelda 25th Anniversary Symphony Concert, a celebratory concert featuring orchestrated versions of classic Zelda themes. Music was also woven into the story and gameplay through the use of the harp Link receives, using a recurring theme within the series of music being a central part of the experience. In contrast to previous games, the instrument could be played at any time rather than at specific times and places.\n\nRelease\nA new Zelda game was first hinted at in April 2008, when Miyamoto stated that the Zelda development team were reforming to create new games. Miyamoto later confirmed at the 2008 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) that a new Zelda was in development for the Wii. The game was unveiled at E3 2009, although its title remained unknown. Due to its in-development state, Miyamoto could not show off gameplay as he had wished. Instead, he showed promotional art featuring Link and Fi. He also announced the game's use of Wii MotionPlus, along with its planned 2010 release window. In a later interview, Aonuma's comments on the game's playability brought this release window into doubt. He also noted that his wish to focus on the new game meant that the release date of Spirit Tracks was shifted to the end of 2009 rather than its initial projected release in early 2010. The game's title was announced at the event, along with its revised release period in 2011 and a playable demonstration. According to Miyamoto, the game was delayed from its planned 2010 release window as the staff felt that they would be releasing an unfinished product if they put the convenience of the company ahead of creating a quality experience. They used the extra year to both finish the core elements and polish up the game as a whole.Multiple promotional elements were created: a five-part online comic was written and illustrated by Jerry Holkins and Mike Krahulik under their Penny Arcade Presents series, and television commercials featuring actor and comedian Robin Williams and his daughter Zelda were made, playing on the actor's stated love for the series. Skyward Sword released in all regions in November 2011: it released in Europe on November 18, North America on November 20, Japan on November 23, and Australia on November 24. The game was released as both a standard edition and a limited deluxe edition that included a gold Wii Remote Plus. An anniversary CD was included with both editions containing orchestrated versions of various iconic musical pieces from the series. Following its release, a glitch was discovered that corrupted save files if three late-game events were taken in a certain order. Once revealed, Nintendo issued instructions on avoiding it and set up a special channel on their Wii site in Japan to gain feedback, along with offering to manually repair corrupted save files. The game was later re-released for the Wii U via the Virtual Console on September 1, 2016, as part of the series' 30th anniversary celebrations.\n\nSkyward Sword HD\nThe Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD, a high-definition remaster for the Nintendo Switch, was announced during a February 2021 Nintendo Direct stream. It was released on July 16, 2021. A Joy-Con pair themed after the Master Sword and Hylian Shield from the game was released separately on the same date.Aonuma stated in June 2016 that it might be possible to create an HD remaster of Skyward Sword for then-current hardware. Years prior, during the development of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Nintendo experimented with an HD version of Skyward Sword running on Wii U development kits when trying to settle on a graphical style for the new game. This ultimately led to the production of The Wind Waker HD, whose success encouraged the Zelda team to pursue other high-definition remasters. In November 2018, Aonuma recognized the interest in a Skyward Sword remaster, though a spokesperson from Nintendo would later clarify to Eurogamer that there were no plans to bring the game to the Nintendo Switch at that time. In August 2020, Amazon UK had listed a Nintendo Switch version of Skyward Sword, though it was delisted soon after.The remaster features high-definition graphics and now plays at 60 frames per second. The remaster features two control schemes, one of which aims to replicate the functions of the Wii Remote Plus and Nunchuck through the motion controls of the Joy-Con, while the other aims to replicate a traditional control scheme by using the right analog stick to control the previously motion-controlled sword. This secondary control method allows the game to be played in handheld mode, on a Pro Controller, and on the Nintendo Switch Lite.Other quality of life features added include autosave, the ability to save to any of the three save files instead of just the original file (which also now includes giving Hero Mode its own slot upon unlocking it as a New Game Plus feature when saved into a file), many of Fi's hints now being optional, the ability to skip dialogue boxes and cutscenes, and item descriptions no longer appearing after the first encounter with an item, with the Gratitude Crystals being the lone exception. One Amiibo figure is supported, being a figure depicting Zelda and a Loftwing enabling fast travel between the sky and the surface.\n\nReception\nSkyward Sword received critical acclaim from multiple journalistic magazines and websites upon release; it received a score of 93/100 on aggregate site Metacritic based on 81 reviews. It was the site's 10th highest scoring game of 2011, and also ranked as the 6th best-reviewed Wii game of all time. It received perfect scores from multiple publications: Famitsu, IGN, Eurogamer, Game Informer, Edge Magazine, and VideoGamer.com. In the case of Famitsu, Skyward Sword was the third Zelda game and sixteenth video game in the magazine's history to be given a perfect score at that time.Famitsu was highly positive, praising the overworld and gameplay: one reviewer felt that it would form the new standard for both the Zelda series and video games as a whole. Edge was highly positive about all aspects of the game aside from the player-driven upgrade system, and even then it was not enough to spoil the experience for the reviewer. Nintendo Power gave it similar praise, saying that \"it's truly worthy of being called 'epic'\". Ray Carsillo of Electronic Gaming Monthly appreciated the game's nostalgic value, but found the motion control difficult to handle and kept the game from being truly great. Jose Otero, writing for 1UP.com, praised the developers for putting effort into moving away from Zelda tradition and called it one of the better games in the series, but said that those detrimental elements that remained such as side quests and some item usage made Skyward Sword \"a weird middle ground filled with genuine surprises, inessential carry-overs, and copy/paste quest structures\".GameSpot's Tom McShea was notably less positive than other critics, praising the storyline, dungeons, enemies and visuals while faulting the controls for being unreliable and feeling that most of the experience felt both unnecessary and overly familiar. Destructoid's Jonathan Holmes called Skyward Sword his new favorite 3D game from the series, but noted that its exclusive use of motion controls would put off potential players. Oli Welsh of Eurogamer was highly positive, praising the controls, gameplay experience and additional elements such as upgrades: he gave particular praise to the game's visuals, which were impressive despite hardware limitations. Game Informer's Phil Kollar echoed both general praise of the gameplay and presentation, and minor issues experienced with the motion controls: he concluded by saying that Nintendo had fulfilled its initial promises for the Wii with Skyward Sword. GamesRadar's Carolyn Gudmundson called it \"perfectly balanced mix of innovation and classic Zelda gameplay\" despite minor control issues.GameTrailers noted that, despite its many strengths such as a believable relationship between Link and Zelda, Skyward Sword represented the series' \"first gray hairs\" due to some of its mechanics feeling dated in the modern gaming landscape. IGN's Richard George felt that the game returned The Legend of Zelda to being a revolutionary series in the gaming industry, praising almost every aspect of the game except for the soundtrack, which he felt did not live up to series standards despite its quality. Joystiq writer Griffin McElroy noted that a lot of the game's content seemed unnecessary and extravagant, but said that beneath this surface lay \"the best Zelda game of all time\". Steve Hogarty of Official Nintendo Magazine shared many points of praise with other positive journalist reviews, calling it the greatest game in the series to date. VideoGamer.com's Chris Schilling called it one of the best Zelda games, praising its motion controls, narrative and treatment of series tradition.\n\nAwards\nFollowing its release, Skyward Sword won numerous awards. At IGN's \"Best of 2011\" awards, it was awarded \"Best Game\", \"Best Graphics\", \"Best Sound\" and \"Best Story\" in the Wii category. It was also given the \"Reader's Choice\" award in the \"Best Overall Game\" category: it was also among those nominated as the site's \"Game of the Year\". In Digital Trends' similar awards, it was named as \"Best Action-Adventure\" and \"Best Wii Exclusive\", and was nominated for the site's \"Game of the Year\" award. RPGamer's own \"Best of 2011\" awards named Skyward Sword \"Best Console and PC Game\" and awarded it for \"Best Music\". It also received \"Game of the Year\" awards from Electronic Gaming Monthly, GameSpot, Edge and Nintendo Power. It received \"Excellence\" and \"Most Valuable Character\" awards from Famitsu, the latter being awarded for the protagonist Link. It received multiple nominations in 2012 at the Interactive Achievement Awards (now known as the D.I.C.E. Awards), Game Developers Choice Awards and the BAFTA Games Awards. At Spike, the game won awards for \"Best Wii Game\" and \"Best Motion Game\". Skyward Sword has since been ranked among the best games developed for the Wii.\n\nSales\nUpon its Japanese debut, Skyward Sword sold nearly 195,000 units, reaching the top of sales charts. Sales quickly declined, dropping out of the Top 20 within a few weeks. By the end of December, it had sold less than 320,000 units: this was below equivalent sales for other recent home console and portable Zelda games. The game's sales were strong overall going into January 2012, with its largest sales coming from North America. Its first month sales in North America came to around 600,000 units, nearly double its Japanese sales. In the UK, Skyward Sword was the seventh best-selling game of November in the multiformat charts, stated as impressive given the waning popularity of the platform. It was also the region's top-selling Wii game during its week of release, supplanting the previous week's top seller Just Dance 3. It failed to reach the top-five best-selling Wii games for that year. Its total worldwide first-week sales came to 919,119 units. According to Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime, Skyward Sword was the fastest-selling game in the series at that time. As of December 2011, the game has sold 3.41 million units worldwide: 380,000 of these units were sold in Japan while 3.04 million units were sold overseas.\n\nSkyward Sword HD\nPre-orders for Skyward Sword HD sold out on Amazon.com and it was listed as the best-selling game on the US version of the site. It sold 159,089 physical copies within its first week on sale in Japan, making it the bestselling retail game of the week in the country.As of December 31, 2021, Skyward Sword HD has sold 3.60 million units worldwide.\n\nLegacy\nWhile critical reception of the game was very positive overall, fan and retrospective opinions were far more mixed due to its highly traditional and linear structure. When development started on the next home console Zelda game, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, the developers wanted to improve on what they had achieved with Skyward Sword and the feedback it received from both fans and critics, along with creating a non-linear world based on player complaints about the linearity of Skyward Sword. Aonuma and Fujibayashi both returned respectively as producer and director. Aonuma's stated wish with Breath of the Wild was \"to expand and make a better Skyward Sword\".\n\nNotes\nReferences\nPrimary references\nNintendo EAD (2011-11-18).
